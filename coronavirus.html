<h1>Coronavirus 2019</h1>
 
<p>Between 17 million, 50 million, or 100 million humans died because of the 1918 Spanish Flu, which was regarded as the dealiest virus pandemic [<a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/187/12/2561/5092383">1</a>][<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11875246">2</a>]. During the yearend of 1918, the global human population was 1.83 billion  [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-by-world-regions-post-1820">3</a>]. The 1918 Spanish Flu killed 0.92%, 2.7%, or 5.4% of 1918's global human population.</p>
 
<p>During the yearend of 2019, the global human population was 7.71 billion [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-by-world-regions-post-1820">3</a>]. What would happen if the 1918 Spanish Flu, was instead the 2019 Spanish Flu? What would happen if the 1918 Spanish Flu had instead occurred during 2019? Then, 70.93 million, 208.17 million, or 416.34 million humans would die because of the 2019 Spanish Flu. But there is no 2019 Spanish Flu. There is only, the 2019 Coronavirus.</p>
 
<p>The CDC says 80% of COVID-19 death victims from China are 60 years or older; 80% of COVID-19 death victims from the USA are age 65 years or older [<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6912e2">4</a>]. According to ISS Italy National Health Institute, 96.3% of COVID-19 death victims from Italy are age 60 years or older, but 99% of all COVID-19 death victims from Italy had a pre-existing medical condition [<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says">5</a>].<p>
 
<p>OP-ED: Liberals are destroying the world's economy of the 99% to save the lives of the 1% who will die from COVID-19. Liberals gave us COVID-19 because they opened our international borders. I'm not saying that Liberals invented the virus, but liberals are certainly taking advantage of the public's fear and ignorance for the anti-racist Marxist agenda.<p>
 
 <p>80% of antibiotic use in the USA was for the purpose of meat slaughter. Do you know why? It is because there are millions of animals living in blood, cadavers, feces, and vomit. We are told a euphemism, that COVID-19 suppinated from bat species. Human COVID-19 began at "Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market," also know as a meat slaughter.</p>
