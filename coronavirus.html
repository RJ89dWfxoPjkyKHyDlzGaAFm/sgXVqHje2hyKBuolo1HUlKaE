<h1>Coronavirus 2019</h1>
 
<p>Between 17 million, 50 million, or 100 million humans died because of the 1918 Spanish Flu, which was regarded as the dealiest virus pandemic [<a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/187/12/2561/5092383">1</a>][<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11875246">2</a>]. During the yearend of 1918, the global human population was 1.83 billion  [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-by-world-regions-post-1820">3</a>]. The 1918 Spanish Flu killed 0.92%, 2.7%, or 5.4% of 1918's global human population.</p>
 
<p>During the yearend of 2019, the global human population was 7.71 billion [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-by-world-regions-post-1820">3</a>]. What would happen if the 1918 Spanish Flu, was instead the 2019 Spanish Flu? What would happen if the 1918 Spanish Flu had instead occurred during 2019? Then, 70.93 million, 208.17 million, or 416.34 million humans would die because of the 2019 Spanish Flu. But there is no 2019 Spanish Flu. There is only, the 2019 Coronavirus.</p>
