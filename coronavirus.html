<h1>Coronavirus 2019</h1>
 
<p>Between 17 million, 50 million, or 100 million humans died because of the 1918 Spanish Flu, which was regarded as the dealiest virus pandemic [<a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/187/12/2561/5092383">1</a>][<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11875246">2</a>]. During the yearend of 1918, the global human population was 1.83 billion  [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-by-world-regions-post-1820">3</a>]. Therefore, the 1918 Spanish Flu killed either 0.92%, 2.7%, or 5.4% of 1918's global human population.</p>
 
<p>During the yearend of 2019, the global human population was 7.71 billion [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-by-world-regions-post-1820">4</a>]. What would happen if the 1918 Spanish Flu, was instead the 2019 Spanish Flu? What would happen if the 1918 Spanish Flu instead occurred during 2019? Then, either (0.92%) 70.93 million, (2.7%) 208.17 million, or (5.4%) 416.34 million humans would die because of the 2019 Spanish Flu. But a 2019 Spanish Flu does not exist. There is only, the 2019 Coronavirus.</p>

 <p>Between 2008-2017, the global death rate was 52.98 million deaths per year, from all causes [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-deaths-by-age-group">4</a>]
 
<p>Between 80% to 96.3% COVID-19 death victims were 60 years and older and had a pre-existing medical condition, in other words, they were going to die anyways. The CDC says 80% of COVID-19 death victims from China are age 60 years or older; 80% of COVID-19 death victims from the USA are age 65 years or older [<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6912e2">5</a>]. According to ISS Italy National Health Institute, 96.3% of COVID-19 death victims from Italy are age 60 years or older, but 99% of all COVID-19 death victims from Italy had a pre-existing medical condition [<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says">6</a>].<p>
 
<p>OP-ED: Liberals are destroying the world's economy of the 99% to save the lives of the 1% who will die from COVID-19. Liberals gave us COVID-19 because they opened our international borders. I'm not saying that Liberals invented the virus, but liberals are certainly taking advantage of the public's fear and ignorance for the anti-racist Marxist agenda.<p>
 
<p>We are told a euphemism, that COVID-19 ostensibly originated from a bat species. But COVID-19 began afterall at "Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market," also know as a disgusting meat slaughter. Meat-eaters invented COVID-19. COVID-19 was preventable.</p>
 
<p>We are told a eupemism, that HIV/AIDS ostensibly originated from a monkey species. But HIV/AIDS began afterall because of African monkey bushmeat, also known as a disgusting meat slaughter. [<a href="https://www.avert.org/professionals/history-hiv-aids/origin">7</a>]</p>
 
<p>Zoonosis is the transfer of bacterial/viral disease between different species. Zoonosis occurs at unsanitary conditions such as meat slaughters where animals are exposed to blood, feces, mucous, saliva, urine, vomit, and miscellaneous bodily fluids. Meat slaughters are so disgusting and unsanitary that 80% of antibiotic usage was for the purpose of meat slaughter.</p>
 
 <p>Of course, there is the video of a woman devouring a nutritous meal of bat species [<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/01/23/revolting-video-shows-woman-devouring-bat-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/">8</a>].</p>
 
<p>The World Health Organization says "That Antibiotic Resistance would pose a serious threat to humanity: It is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country. Antibiotic resistance–when bacteria change so antibiotics no longer work in people who need them to treat infections–is now a major threat to public health."</p>
 
 <p>Wow. Who would have thought that killing trillions of animals would become the death of humanity? Adolf Hitler says "But there's one thing I can predict to eaters of meat: the world of the future will be vegetarian."</p>
 
 <p>Of course, Liberals hate that quote by Adolf Hitler. Liberals are unwilling to view the world objectively. Adolf Hitler was not a perfect vegetarian. But vegetarianism is a moralistic idea regardless if Adolf Hitler or Ghandi said it.</p>
 
<p>It's so funny how Nazis knew tobacco causes cancer since the 1930s, and banned it [<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/07/the-nazis-forgotten-anti-smoking-campaign/373766/">9</a>]. But in America, you had Jewish propagandist Edward Bernays who was brainwashing Americans to smoke more cigarettes. And it's so funny how the original plan by the Third Reich was to send the Jews to Madagascar. The plan was abadoned upon realizing that Jews could seek revenge. But in 1939 Jewish Albert Einstein wrote a letter, on how to make an Atomic Bomb, to the President of the USA named Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Then, it was a Jewish man named Julius Robert Oppenheimer who invented the Atomic Bomb for the USA, thus obliberating Nazi Germany. Hiroshima happend on August 6, 1945. World War 2 ended on September 2, 1945.</p>
