<h1>Coronavirus 2019</h1>
 
<p>Between 17 million, 50 million, or 100 million humans died because of the 1918 Spanish Flu, which was regarded as the dealiest virus pandemic [<a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/187/12/2561/5092383">1</a>][<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11875246">2</a>]. During the yearend of 1918, the global human population was 1.83 billion  [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-by-world-regions-post-1820">3</a>]. Therefore, the 1918 Spanish Flu killed either 0.92%, 2.7%, or 5.4% of 1918's global human population.</p>
 
<p>During the yearend of 2019, the global human population was 7.71 billion [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-by-world-regions-post-1820">4</a>]. What would happen if the 1918 Spanish Flu, was instead the 2019 Spanish Flu? What would happen if the 1918 Spanish Flu instead occurred during 2019? Then, either (0.92%) 70.93 million, (2.7%) 208.17 million, or (5.4%) 416.34 million humans would die because of the 2019 Spanish Flu. But a 2019 Spanish Flu does not exist. There is only, the 2019 Coronavirus.</p>

<p>Between 2008-2017, the global death rate was 52.98 million (52,989,249.44) deaths per year from ALL causes [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-deaths-by-age-group">5</a>]. 
  
<p>COVID-19 began because of zoonosis. Zoonosis is the transfer of bacterial/viral diseases between taxonomic species. Zoonosis occurs at unsanitary facilities such as meat slaughters where animals are exposed to blood, feces, mucous, saliva, urine, vomit, and miscellaneous bodily fluids. We are told a ephemism that COVID-19 ostensibly originated from a bat species. But COVID-19 began afterall at "Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market," also known as a disgusting meat slaughter. Meat-eaters invented COVID-19. COVID-19 was preventable. Meat slaughter is so disgusting and unsanitary that 70% to 80% of antibiotic usage during 2013 was for meat slaughter [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/antibiotic-resistance-from-livestock">6</a>]. Global antiobiotic usage is expected to increase as African countires develop too.</p>
 
 <p>2014: The World Health Organization says "That Antibiotic Resistance would pose a serious threat to humanity: It is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country. Antibiotic resistance–when bacteria change so antibiotics no longer work in people who need them to treat infections–is now a major threat to public health." [<a href="https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/amr-report/en/">7</a>]</p>
 
<p>2018: The World Health Organization says "Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today. Antibiotic resistance can affect anyone, of any age, in any country. Antibiotic resistance occurs naturally, but misuse of antibiotics in humans and animals is accelerating the process." [<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antibiotic-resistance">8</a>]
 
<p>Of course, there is the video of a woman devouring a nutritous meal of bat species [<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/01/23/revolting-video-shows-woman-devouring-bat-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/">9</a>]. Zoonosis occurs not in soup. Zoonosis occurs before soup is cooked. Zoonosis occurs at meat slaughters.</p>  
 
<p>April 10, 2020: The CDC says 77.9% of COVID-19 death victims from the USA were 65 years or older; 90.4% were 55 years or older. [<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/COVID19/index.htm">5</a>].</p> 
 
<p>According to ISS Italy National Health Institute, 96.3% of COVID-19 death victims from Italy were 60 years or older; 99% of all COVID-19 death victims from Italy had a pre-existing medical condition [<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says">6</a>].</p>
 
<p>OP-ED: Liberals are destroying the world's economy of the 99% to save the lives of the 1% who will die from COVID-19. Liberals gave us COVID-19 because they opened our international borders. I'm not saying that Liberals invented the virus, but liberals are certainly taking advantage of the public's fear and ignorance for the anti-racist Marxist agenda.<p>
 
<p>We are told a eupemism, that HIV/AIDS ostensibly originated from a monkey species. But HIV/AIDS began afterall because of African monkey bushmeat, also known as a disgusting meat slaughter. [<a href="https://www.avert.org/professionals/history-hiv-aids/origin">7</a>]</p>
 
 <p>>Adolf Hitler was not a perfect vegetarian. But vegetarianism is a nice idea regardless if Adolf Hitler or Ghandi said it. Adolf Hitler said "But there's one thing I can predict to eaters of meat: the world of the future will be vegetarian."</p>
 
<p>The Third Reich were aware of tobacco's cancerous effects since the 1930s, and banned it [<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/07/the-nazis-forgotten-anti-smoking-campaign/373766/">10</a>]. Meanhile in 1930s America, a propagandist Jew named Edward Bernays brainwashed Americans to smoke more cigarettes.</p>
 
But in 1939 Scientist Jew Albert Einstein wrote a letter, on how to make an Atomic Bomb, to the President of the USA named Franklin Delano Roosevelt. A scientist Jew named Julius Robert Oppenheimer invented the Atomic Bomb for the USA. Hiroshima occured on August 6, 1945. World War 2 ended on September 2, 1945. American Jews defeated the Third Reich.</p>
