<h1>Coronavirus 2019</h1>
 
<p>Between 17 million, 50 million, or 100 million humans died because of the 1918 Spanish Flu, which was regarded as the dealiest virus pandemic [<a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/187/12/2561/5092383">1</a>][<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11875246">2</a>]. During the yearend of 1918, the global human population was 1.83 billion  [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-by-world-regions-post-1820">3</a>]. The 1918 Spanish Flu killed 0.92%, 2.7%, or 5.4% of 1918's global human population.</p>
 
<p>During the yearend of 2019, the global human population was 7.71 billion [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-by-world-regions-post-1820">3</a>]. What would happen if the 1918 Spanish Flu, was instead the 2019 Spanish Flu? What would happen if the 1918 Spanish Flu had instead occurred during 2019? Then, 70.93 million, 208.17 million, or 416.34 million humans would die because of the 2019 Spanish Flu. But there is no 2019 Spanish Flu. There is only, the 2019 Coronavirus.</p>
 
<p>The CDC says 80% of COVID-19 death victims from China are 60 years or older; 80% of COVID-19 death victims from the USA are age 65 years or older [<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6912e2">4</a>]. According to ISS Italy National Health Institute, 96.3% of COVID-19 death victims from Italy are age 60 years or older, but 99% of all COVID-19 death victims from Italy had a pre-existing medical condition [<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says">5</a>].<p>
 
<p>OP-ED: Liberals are destroying the world's economy of the 99% to save the lives of the 1% who will die from COVID-19. Liberals gave us COVID-19 because they opened our international borders. I'm not saying that Liberals invented the virus, but liberals are certainly taking advantage of the public's fear and ignorance for the anti-racist Marxist agenda.<p>
 
<p>In the USA, 80% of antibiotic use was for the purpose of meat slaughter. Do you know why? It is because there are millions of animals living in blood, cadavers, feces, and vomit. We are told a euphemism, that COVID-19 ostensibly originated from a bat species. But COVID-19 began afterall at "Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market," also know as a disgusting meat slaughter. Meat-eaters invented COVID-19. COVID-19 was preventable. HIV begins in Africa, originated from monkeys, but somehow Africans consume monkey meat [<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/african-monkey-meat-that-could-be-behind-the-next-hiv-7786152.html">5</a>]. There is nothing accidental about forgetting to rinse, wash, sanitize a bloody table which bears the bloody limbs of animals. Of course, there is the video of a woman devouring a nutritous meal of bat species [<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/01/23/revolting-video-shows-woman-devouring-bat-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/">5</a>].</p>
 
<p>The World Health Organization says "That Antibiotic Resistance would pose a serious threat to humanity: It is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country. Antibiotic resistance–when bacteria change so antibiotics no longer work in people who need them to treat infections–is now a major threat to public health."</p>
 
 <p>Wow. Who would have thought that killing trillions of animals would become the death of humanity? Adolf Hitler says "But there's one thing I can predict to eaters of meat: the world of the future will be vegetarian."</p>
 
 <p>Of course, Liberals hate that quote by Adolf Hitler. Liberals are unwilling to view things objectively. Adolf Hitler had some good ideas, for example Adolf Hitler believed in Marxism, which is ironic since Karl Marx was a Jew. There is evidence that Adolf Hitler consumed meat, and everything was a propaganist plot to make Hitler's diet appear disciplined, it made Hitler seem other worldy. So what? Many vegan occassionally consume animal products. But Vegetarianism is a good idea no matter if Adolf Hitler says it or Ghandi.</p>
 
<p>It's so funny how Nazis knew tobacco causes cancer since the 1930s, and banned it [<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/07/the-nazis-forgotten-anti-smoking-campaign/373766/">6</a>]. But in America, you had Jewish propagandist Edward Bernays who was brainwashing Americans to smoke more cigarettes. </p>
