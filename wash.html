<h1>Part One</h1>
<p>My grandpa is having pain on his penis. The doctor diagnosed my grandpa with UTI caused by phimosis."</p>
<p>So finally, I created a powerpoint for my grandpa, with cartoon pictures of penises, and I politely explained to him "You gotta wash yo damn dick boi!!!" You will never believe what happens next. Face palm. My grandpa replied "I can't wash my penis, because if I wash it, it might get infected." I replied "You already have an infection. The infection created the pain." My grandpa replied "I don't have an infection. I just have pain. I need to fix this pain or else this could lead to an infection." Face palm. Basically, my grandpa is over 70+ years and has never washed his penis with soap, and now there is a fungus growing on it. And he refuses to wash it... I tried to tell him...</p>
<p>We went back to the doctor and demanded the doctor to give my grandpa a circumcision, it will fix my grandpa's pain. The doctor replied "Why are we going to circumsize you? It says here, you have six months left to live. Can't do it. Insurance won't accept this." Next week, my uncle's caretaker said "I can't work for you anymore, says here, you hired a different caretaker."</p>
<p>We asked my grandpa "What is your fucking deal?!" My grandpa replied "Alright. A sexy woman who drives a lamborghini paid me $200 and all I had to do was give her my social security, birth certificate, and ID. If I recommend another elderly person, she will pay me another $200." So basically, my grandpa got scammed by insurance fraud scammers. Come to find out, this bitch is married and pretended to be single so she could scam elderly men more easily. And the saddest part is my grandpa is so poor, he actually needed those $200.</p>
<p>So finally, I went to my whole entire family, and I screamed "I'm going to prison, that's it, I don't care anymore, I'm tired of this fucking bitch, call the scammer, tell her we have another elderly person who wants $200, soon as I see that bitch driving that lamborghini, I'm going to blow her brains out with my shot gun!! I am sick and tired of this wicked evil world!! It's time to take matters into our own hands. The government, police, insurance companies, they're all in on it!! Hold my weave! Hold my weave!!"
