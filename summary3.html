<p>According to wikipedia, “Virtually all scholars of antiquity accept that Jesus was a historical figure, and attempts to deny his historicity have been consistently rejected by the scholarly consensus as a fringe theory.”</p>
<p>We know Jesus is real because authors outside the bible wrote books describing Jesus. For example, a guy named Thallus wrote that on the day Jesus died, he personally witnessed a total lunar eclipse. This is scientifically impossible. But Thallus was not a random crackhead off the street, he was a well respected historian. The only atheist explanation is Thallus was a victim of the Jesus cult.</p>
<p>There really was a guy named Jesus, who was murdered, and his body vanished. According to atheists, Jesus’s body was probably kidnapped by an obsessed fan.</p>

<h1>Tower of Babel</h1>
<p>There is a real town called Borsippa. It has an unfinished tower with a crack down the middle of it and an inscription basically saying “This tower was struck by lighting in the middle of its construction. It was never completed because the workers were too spooked, leading to verbal disagreements.”</p>

<h1>Giants</h1>
<p>There is a real town called Tell es-Safi whose walls are very tall, and the people used to walk by and say “Wholly molly, only a giant could have built those walls” and so everyone who lived in that town earned the nickname “Giants.” In other words, all the giants in the bible were not literally giants, it was just a nickname.</p>

<h1>Sodom and Gomorrah</h1>
<p>There is a real town called Tall el-Hammam which was destroyed by a meteor. The town was reduced to ashes. So everyone said “God did it, He turned everyone to pillars of salt.”</p>

<h1>Battle of Jericho<br></h1>
<p>There is a real town called Tell es-Sultan whose walls are laying on the ground. John Garstang concluded the walls collapsed due to an earthquake. Two atheist theories here. The first theory is, there was an earthquake, the walls fell, and the invaders said “This is a sign from God, now is the perfect time to invade!” The second theory is, there was never an earthquake, the town was invaded, and the walls were knocked down for propaganda reasons.</p>

<h1>Prophecy: 70 Years of Babylonian Captivity<br>(Jeremiah 29:10)</h1>
<p>Basically, God said “Jews will live under Babylonian Captivity for 70 years.” Officially, the Babylonian Captivity lasted 60 years, but you can find many historians who give excuses of why it was actually 70 years, like “Use a different calendar system” or “legally speaking they were free on 538BCE, but spiritually speaking, they were free on 516BCE, on the exact date the Jerusalem temple was rebuilt.”</p>
<h1>Prophecy: Siege of Tyre (Ezekiel 26)</h1>
<p>Basically, somewhere between 622BCE-570BCE (Ezekiel’s lifespan), God said “The city of Tyre will be conquered by Nebuchadnezzar, afterwards, you will see multiple invasion attempts, they will deconstruct your buildings, lay the debris upon the water, and the city of Tyre will never be great again, it will turn into a place where fishermen dry their nets.”</p> 
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tyre_(332_BC)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tyre_(332_BC)</a></p>
<p>238 years later, the prophecy finally came true. Nebuchadnezzar conquered it in 585BCE. The town was split in half, some lived on the mainland, some lived on the nearby island. In 332BCE, Alexander The Great easily conquered the mainland, but it took multiple invasion attempts to conquer the island. So Alexendar The Great’s army deconstructed the mainland’s buildings, and laid the debris upon the water to install catapults against the island. Today, the mainland is abandoned, and the island is nothing more than a place where fishermen dry their nets.</p>

<h1>Prophecy: Battle of Opis<br>(Isaiah 45:1-13)<br>(Isaiah 14:23)</h1>
<p>Basically, somewhere between 800BCE-700BCE (Isaiah’s lifespan), God said “A guy named Cyrus will defeat Babylon, he will walk in through the gates without fighting, and Babylon will be reduced into a swampland.” 160 years later, in 539BCE, this prophecy actually came true.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Opis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Opis</a></p>
<p>The city of Opis was protected by thick wall and surrounded by two deadly rivers. Everyone thought it was impossible to conquer Opis. But Cyrus did a sneak attack by “diverting the Euphrates river into a canal so that the water level dropped ‘to the height of the middle of a man’s thigh’, which allowed the invading forces to march directly through the river bed to enter at night.” Cyrus strategically planned this sneak attack on the exact date when the city of Opis was experiencing festivities. When Cyrus’s army marched in, the entire town was drunk, and that’s how Cyrus defeated them without fighting. Today, the city of Opis remains underwater due to what is called “Mesopotamian Marshes.” Now it is literally a swampland.</p>

<p>This prophecy is so crazy, the atheists invented a conspiracy theory called “deutro-isaiah” where they say the bible must have been tampered. But there is literally no basis for this conspiracy theory. We know the bible has never been tampered because there are multiple copies of the bible from different time periods, and all of them are exactly the same, except for a few mispelled words.</p>
<p>Therefore, the only atheist explanation is there was probably a random guy, his name wasn’t Cyrus, but then everyone said “He is the guy from the prophecy! It’s him!” So they changed his name to Cyrus. In other words, it was a self-fulfilling prophecy. I am a doubter myself, and I have a theory about the swampland, I bet it was some crazy ass religious people digging holes between the rivers to make this prophecy come true. Or probably the people were smart back then, and noticed the water level was rising.</p>
<h1>Equidistant Letter Sequence</h1>
<p>These scientists stared at the bible for so long until they started seeing math equations, and they turned the bible into an alphabet soup, and started saying “The bible contains secret encoded messages, prophesies, its the end times!!”</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_code">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_code</a></p>
<h1>End Times</h1>
<p>They say we are currently living in a prophesy. During Babylonian Captivity, under Nebuchadnezzar II, there was no freedom of religion. But God said “I do not give a sh*t if Nebuchadnezzar II tortures you to death for worshipping me. You should not fear humanity. You should only fear me. Therefore, I am adding 2,483.8 days to your punishment.” They say this punishment ended on exactly May 14, 1948, on the exact date when Israel became a country.</p>
<p style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Matthew 24:32–34</p>
<p>This bible quote means all the prophecies have run out, and there is only one prophecy left, end times...</p>
<h1>Global Warming</h1>
<p>In the year 2159, the whole world will completely run out of fossil fuels. But according to liberals, if we burn all of it, we will all die from Anthropogenic Climate Change. So according to liberals, we are only allowed to burn about 36.8%, so we really only have until 2071 to ‘solve global warming’. In other words, no matter if you are religious or scientist, the world as we know it is coming to an end. Even liberals are realizing ‘renewable energy’ is a lie, see <i>Planet of the Humans</i> by Michael Moore.</p>
