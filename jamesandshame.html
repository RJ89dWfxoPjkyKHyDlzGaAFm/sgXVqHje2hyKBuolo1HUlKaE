<p>Rhett James Mclaughlin was an evangelical christian. But when he moved to california, he suddenly stopped worshipping God, and also he started a band called James and the Shame where he blasphemies God.</p>

<p><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/pNLFPkc69OI">https://youtu.be/pNLFPkc69OI</a></p>
<p>This song is about people telling him "Why did you stop believing in God? Were you molested by the church? Did something traumatic happen? Oh I get it. You sold your soul to the devil for fame and fortune. You were never a real christian."</p>


<h1>Rhett Cries</h1>

<p>When Rhett was a kid, he thought he was spreading the word of God, but in reality, he was spreading racism. That's why he is crying. His entire childhood was based on a lie.</p>

<h1>James and the Shame</h1>
<p>Rhett feels ashamed for leaving the church, and ashamed for having been a part of it. When people say "you were never a real christian," it hurts Rhett the most, because Rhett used to literally talk to God every single day. He used to feel God's presence. He used to love God, more than anything in the world. Rhett wishes he could say "Please, believe me. I did my best to believe in God." That's why his song is called Believe Me.</p>

<h1>"You say my heart was never true,<br>but that might say more about you."</h1>
<p>Rhett is going to hell for not believing in God. And the fact God would send a man to hell for something stupid like that, that only proves to Rhett that God is not real. Like "I devoted my life to you, I gave you my heart & soul, and now you say I'm not a <b>real</b> christian, simply because I believe in science & evolution? It sounds to me like maybe you're not a <b>real</b> God."</p>

<h1>Rhett Cries Again</h1>
<p>When Rhett was a kid, his bestfriend Ben died of cancer. During Ben's final days of fighting cancer, Rhett told Ben "Please, Ben I am begging you to repent for your sins, let Jesus into your heart, or else you will burn in hell." Ben was agnostic.</p>

<h1>Rhett's Blog</h1>

<h1>But most of all...<br>Rhett is deeply ashamed of his white ancestry</h1>
<p>Here is proof. Rhett said "I hate being a straight white male."</p>

<p>If you rewind the audio. Basically, Rhett said he feels an urge to boss people around at his job. But, because he is a straight white man, he wants to give minorites an opportunity to be in a position of power. That is why Rhett gave up all his power, and gave it to Stevie Wynne Levine. Stevie is the boss of Rhett & Link. She is lesbian and jewish <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/kyqEpWuXADM?t=422">1</a>.</p>
<p>If you listen to "Good Mythical Crew Podcast: Episode 1" you will see. Stevie is the master mind behind Mythical Entertainment, because she is connected to hollywood agents. Rhett and Link called Stevie "Our first employee."</p>

<p>So that's why Rhett's band is called "James & the shame." Because he feels deeply ashamed to be a straight white man. James is Rhett's middle name. Also, Rhett is not an atheist, he calls himself a "hopeful agnostic."</p>

<p>Also, here's a fun fact about Rhett. Rhett is 6 feet and 7 inches tall, and he feels ashamed to be tall. He slouches his shoulders to make himself seem smaller. Because he wants to humble himself.</p>
