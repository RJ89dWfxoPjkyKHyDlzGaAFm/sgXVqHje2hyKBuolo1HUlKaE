<p>Rhett James Mclaughlin was a practicing evangelical christian. One day, he moved to california, and stopped believing in God, and also he started a band called James and the Shame.</p>

<p><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/pNLFPkc69OI">https://youtu.be/pNLFPkc69OI</a></p>
<p>This song is about people telling him "Why did you stop believing in God? Were you molested by the church? Did something traumatic happen? Oh I get it. You sold your soul to the devil for fame and fortune. You were never a real christian."</p>


<h1>Rhett Cries</h1>

<p>When Rhett was a kid, he thought he was spreading the word of God, but in reality, he was spreading racism. That's why he is crying. His entire childhood was based on a lie.</p>

<h1>James and the Shame</h1>
<p>Rhett feels ashamed for leaving the church, and ashamed for having been a part of it. When people say "you were never a real christian," it hurts Rhett the most, because Rhett used to literally talk to God every single day. He used to feel God's presence. He used to love God, more than anything in the world. Rhett wishes he could say "Please, believe me. I did my best to believe in God." That's why his song is called Believe Me.</p>

<h1>"You say my heart was never true,<br>but that might say more about you."</h1>
<p>Rhett is going to hell for not believing in God. And the fact God would send a man to hell for something stupid like that, that only proves to Rhett that God is not real. Like "I devoted my life to you, I gave you my heart & soul, and now you say I'm not a <b>real</b> christian, because I believe in evolution? It sounds to me like maybe you're not a <b>real</b> God."</p>

<p>"But there goes my pride, that I should be seen as justified." Supposedly, Satan is paying Rhett to create anti-christian propaganda which will inspire millions of children to disobey God. Rhett's pride wants to prove those allegations are false. But ultimately, Rhett believes being a good person is more important than being perceived as one. And the pursuit of truth is more important than the pursuit of prideful sins.</p>


<h1>Rhett Cries Again</h1>
<p>Ben had cancer but did not believe in God, so in the last of days, Rhett told Ben "Please, Ben I am begging you to repent for your sins, you must believe in God, or else you will go to hell."</p>
