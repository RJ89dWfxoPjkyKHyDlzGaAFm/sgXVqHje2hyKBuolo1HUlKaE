<h1>Need a ride home in my Lamborghini?</h1>
<p>While Jesse Watters was married to Noelle Inguagiato, he was having an affair with Emma DiGiovine. Jesse Watters was the boss of Emma DiGiovine, and one day, Jesse Watters removed the air out of Emma DiGiovine's car tire, and told her "It looks like your tire is flat. Do you need a ride home?" And that's how Jesse Watters and Emma DiGiovine started dating!</p>

<h1>Lana Rhoades</h1>
<p>Lana Rhoades was married to @BigDad_87, and he cheated on her a bunch of times, so they broke up. Then, Lana Rhoades began dating Mike Majlak, and he cheated on her a bunch of times too. Mike bragged about how easy it was to cheat on her. So Mike and Lana broke up. Then, Lana Rhoades got pregnant by an NBA player. And this NBA player told Lana "Go fuck yourself", so they broke up. And now Lana Rhoades is a single mother.</p>

<p>This video went viral because Lana Rhoades confessed that when she was a pornstar, they forced her to drink a concoction of urine and vomit, and Lana Rhoades is such a nice person, she couldn't say no, "I just wanted to make everyone happy so I prentended to enjoy it and now I am traumatized." According to PornHub.com, during 2019, Lana Rhoades was the most searched pornstar in the world. But now she is a retired pornstar. </p>

<p>To add more context. Paige Jennings is also a retired pornstar. The biggest issue she had with the porn industry is the fact grown men will hang out at high school parties, and look for underage girls, and groom them "You will be a great pornstar, you will make a lot of money." And on the first porn scene the director says "Do anal." And the 18 year old girl says "But... I don't want to do anal." The director replies "I thought you wanted to be a pornstar. Every one does anal. It's the industry standard. You're the only one who is complaining. Hurry up, we have writers, producers, editors, actors, and everyone is waiting on you. We rented this wearhouse for half an hour." And that's how they peer pressure 18 year olds into drinking urine and vomit.</p>

<p>According to PornHub.com, during 2015, Mia Khalifa was the most searched pornstar in the world. And even though she was the most searched porn star on Earth, Mia Khalifa only got paid a grand total of $12,000. Similarly, Lana Rhoades went from $100,000 to $24 million by switching to OnlyFans.</p>

<h1>Silent Treatment</h1>
<p>Kipling Williams has a Phd in social psychology. Kipling Williams met with a couple who lived a tragic love story <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/03/psychology-of-silent-treatment-abuse/618411/">1</a>. A husband and wife got into a small argument. The husband reacted by giving the silent treatment to his wife. This silent treatment lasted 40 years. It ended because the husband died, but even on his death bed the husband never uttered a word to his wife. Kipling asked the wife "why did you stay married to him for that long?" The woman replied "Because at least he kept a roof over my head."</p>

<p>Shawn Custis was found guilty of assaulting the woman in the above video. As Shawn awaited trial, allegedly Shawn threatened the police officer "When this gate opens, I'm going to bash your face in like I did that bitch in Millburn." Shawn's first mistress told the court (D.S.) "Shawn love bombed me, so I blocked his ass. Couple weeks later, I recognized Shawn on the television as the news played that video. Immediately, I called the police and told them everything I knew about Shawn including his phone number." Shawn's second mistress told the court (C.B.) "My daughter and I recognized Shawn on the television... Shawn is the love of my life. But I had many sleepless nights thinking about the victim. I felt so sorry for her. Finally, I called the police." Shawn's third mistress told the court (G.N) "I too recognized Shawn on the television. I was terrified of Shawn, but once I saw he was arrested, I finally decided to come forward with my story." Shawn's fiancee was caught on video telling the police "Go ahead, search my apartment. My boyfriend is innocent. He would never do anything like that. I fully consent to everything." But when she showed up to court, she changed her story to "The cops were racist, they did police brutality on my ass, and forced me to sign papers. I did not consent to shit." Shawn's lawyer told the court "Shawn had affairs with these women, so now these women are teamed up and are lying to get revenge. The nanny cam is blurry, you can't see his face. Plus the cops are racist. They planted DNA evidence." The police found blood stained clothing with the victim's DNA in Shawn's fiancee's apartment. The victim told the court "I suffered a fracure on my spinal column. I have PTSD about windows because Shawn attacked me through a window, so now it's been years since I felt safe enough to open a window to let fresh air into my home."</p>

<h1>Brittani Taylor</h1>
<p>This is a summary of Brittani Taylor's story. You can watch the 43 minute documentary on Youtube <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnBh4Riu0RE">1</a>,<a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/sNuKpwX6Tz4?t=167">2</a>. There is also the book titled "A Sucky Love Story." I am paraphrasing everything here.</p>

<p>Brittani Taylor said "A long time ago, I downloaded Tinder, and that was how I met my very attractive, charismatic, and wealthy boyfriend Milos Mihajlovic." Milos lived in a luxurious apartment, drove a luxury car, wore designer clothing, and dined at luxury restaurants. Brittani asked "How did you acquire so much wealth?" Milos replied "My family in Serbia is involved in different businesses like furniture, hotels, restaurants, and night clubs. Also, I teach professional tennis which pays me $150 per hour." This is a screenshot of Milos dating profile.</p>

<p>One day Brittani asked Milos "Do we need birth control?" Milos replied "The 'pull out' method guarantees you won't get pregnant. I learned this in college. I am studying to be a doctor." The 'pull out' method failed. Brittani got pregnant. Now that Brittani was pregnant, Milos said "I just received a phone call. They said my business is not doing well. I can't afford this luxurious lifestyle anymore. They took my car and apartment away. Can I please borrow some of your money? I promise this is temporary."</p>

<p>When Brittani was 4 months pregnant, she told Milos "I gave you so many chances. You've been unemployed for 5 months. Because of you, I am $20,000 in debt. It's over between us. You need to leave right now. I packed your bags already." Milos reacted violently. Brittani flung her arms in self defense. And Milos said "Ow! You injured my eye! I need to go to the hospital immediately!" Milos drove away by himself to the "hospital." Milos returned with an eye patch. Brittani felt so sorry for hurting his eye and so she said "I will give you a few more months." Several weeks later, Milos said "I received a phone call. They said my business has improved. I'm rich again. Things are back to normal. This is a miracle."</p>

<p>When Brittani finally gave birth, Milos said "The doctors told me I have a few months left to live. They diagnosed me with cancer and prescribed me Rituxin. Please come with me Brittani. Before I die, I want you to visit my beautiful home country of Serbia. When I die, I want to leave all my wealth to you and our son. I am writing my death will, so I need your ID, birth certificate, and social security." Everytime Milos returned from his cancer treatments, Milos turned into a verbally abusive maniac. One time Milos told Brittani "My family is in the serbian mafia. I have killed people before. I have seen dead bodies nailed to walls. Heads in soups. Have you seen a movie titled The Whistleblower starring Rachel Weisz? That's what my life is like." The Whistleblower is a movie about human trafficking. Concerned for Milo's mental health, and believing it was a side-effect of his cancer drugs, Brittani asked google "What is Rituxin?" Google said "Rituxin is always administered through an IV bag." Brittani knew from personal experience that IV bags always leave a bruise on the forearms. Brittani examined Milos's arm, and then Brittani said to herself "Oh my god! Milos is faking cancer!" Brittani reported Milos to the police "My boyfriend is stealing my identity, he's lying about cancer, he wants me to visit his home country." The police replied "The FBI is here to ask you some questions about Milos." The FBI said "We've encountered this scenario countless of times before. Most likely, if you had gone to Serbia with Milos, the serbian mafia was going to kidnap your newborn infant. Your infant was going to be kept in a brothel where pedophiles were going to pay millions to have sex with your infant. Brittani replied "This can't be true. I have proof that Milos is rich. These are Milo's bank statements." The FBI replied "Those are forged documents."</p>

<p>Brittani re-examined her whole relationship and realized every single thing Milos ever told was a complete and utter lie. Milos was never rich. Milos faked being rich by renting cars, renting tuxedos, and forging bank statements. Milos purchased clothes from a costume store and he took selfies pretending to be a pre-med student. Milos was never enrolled in any college. But Milos was so dedicated to his lies that he purchased college flashcards and told Brittani "Can you help me study these flashcards for my college exam?" Milos spent hours staring at college textbooks.</p>

<p>During the criminal investigation, Brittani came into contact with Milo's other victims. Those women put their stories togther, and they figured out that not only is Milos a compulsive liar, he also is a compulsive cheater. Everytime Milos "went to work," or "went to school," Milos was just out there driving fast cars, snorting cocaine, and having sex with super models. Milos was so handsome, everytime he walked into a bar, beautiful women flocked towards him. One rich old lady named Oksana told Milos "If you come to my house, I will buy you a car, and pay you thousands per month." And Milos had several rich old women all lined up paying him money. And everytime Milos was caught cheating, he came up with elaborate lies.</p>

<h1>The Bobbits</h1>
<p>According to the official narrative, Lorena Bobbit cut of John's penis due to Battered Woman Syndrome. However, according to one alternative theory by David C. Reardon Phd <a aria-hidden="true" href="http://afterabortion.org/PAR/V4/n23/INTRO.htm">1</a>, the real reason Lorena cut off John's penis was due to Post Abortion Syndrome.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1990, Lorena Bobbit discovered she was pregnant, and it was the happiest moment of her life. Lorena always wanted to be a mother. She drove to a store, purchased a baby's bib, returned home, and told John "I have very good news. Close your eyes." She put the baby's bib on John, and she said "Open your eyes. I'm pregnant with your child John!" Immediately, John stood up and yelled "Hell no!! I don't want to be a father! I am taking you to an abortion clinic!" On June 15th, 1990 Lorena aborted her fetus. Consequently, Lorena stopped having sex with John. Lorena followed the catholic religion. She believed in neither abortions nor divorces. She felt trapped in that relationship. Before the abortion, John had never raped Lorena. It was only after the abortion that John started raping Lorena. On June 15th 1993, Lorena told herself "Today my baby would have turned 3 years old, but John killed my baby when he forced me to have that abortion!" Three days later, on June 18th 1993, John drank alcohol and said "Today is our 4th marriage anniversary. That means you owe me sex." He raped her, and passed out due to over drinking. And then Lorena cut off John's penis. According to this theory, she was seeking revenge for the murder of her unborn child.<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21619&authkey=%21AAbx1MLVkNE_Yys" type="video/mp4"></video><br>
In "The Bobbitts: Love Hurts" documentary, Lorena described all the physical and sexual abuse she endured, but none of that made her cry during the interview. Lorena only cried when the interviewer asked "Did you become pregnant by John?", and immediately Lorena broke down into tears of sadness as she decribed her abortion experience. This shows Lorena did not cut off John's penis because of the physical and sexual abuse. She cut off John's penis because she was seeking revenge for the murder of her unborn child.</p>
