<h1>Meaning of Life</h1>
<p>God is not real. Therefore, we should not wait for God to bring us salvation. We have to bring salvation unto ourselves. One day a prodigy will be born who will provide humanity with the technology to destroy the universe. By destroying the universe, we will finally stop suffering <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://theconversation.com/solve-suffering-by-blowing-up-the-universe-the-dubious-philosophy-of-human-extinction-149331">6</a>. It is not enough to destroy our own planet, there might be other animals suffering in the other galaxies. In the end of days there will be a holy war among those who wish to preserve the universe, and those who wish to destroy it.

<h1>Free-Will</h1>
<p>The best predeterminism evidence is Benjamin Libet's experiment <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/lmI7NnMqwLQ?t=838">2</a>. The 3 types of Wills are Free-Will, Free-Won't, and Predeterminism. Here are examples of each based on homosexuality. And simply replace "homosexuality" with anything such as "overeating, depression, laziness, criminality."</p>

<p>Free-Will: I made the educated decision to be straight. There is no such thing as a gay gene. Gay is a choice. If you are gay it's because you were raised in a gay household or you were influenced by gay propaganda in the media.</p>

<p>Free-Won't: I acknowledge there are biological mechanisms that makes certain humans more likely to do homosexual acts. As humans, we can't control our emotions, but we have complete control over our behavior. The human spirit allows us to veto the impulses of the human flesh, and so we control our own destiny.</p>

<p>Predeterminism: Every particle in the universe is connected. A star exploding in another galaxy can influence your thoughts and behavior here on Earth. The universe is not infinite, it is 13.8 billion years old, 93 billion light years in diameter, and a grand total of 10⁸⁰ particles. If we acknowledge the exact position and momentum of every particle in the universe, then we could create predict any past, present, and future event. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle suggests it might be impossible to know the exact position and momentum of a particle, however Albert Einstein responded "God does not play dice with the universe." That quote means quantum mechanics is seemingly random, but somewhere in that randomness there is a math equation we haven't realized yet. Albert Einstein changed his quote to "God tirelessly plays dice under laws which he has himself prescribed <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.livescience.com/65697-einstein-letters-quantum-physics.html">3</a>." This updated quote means there is a math equation within quantum mechanics that only God himself is capable of understanding, and mortal humans may never be able to reverse engineer it, this is a mathematical "one-way function <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://philosopherdeveloper.com/posts/universe-is-a-one-way-function.html">4</a>." Life is like a book, every character believes they can alter certain events, but no matter what each character says, does, or believes, they are destined to behave exactly as the book is written. Think about your favorite movie, no matter how many times you watch it over and over, it always ends the same though each character seems oblivious. Whether you seemingly decide to be gay or not be gay, it is never a choice. You are not the owner of your thoughts, the universe is.</p>

<p>If you believe in God, it means God doesn't make mistakes, He had a plan from the very beginning, like we are here to be taught a lesson. Albert Einstein said "Everything is determined, the beginning as well as the end, by forces over which we have no control. It is determined for the insect as well as for the star. Human beings, vegetables, or cosmic dust, we all dance to a mysterious tune, intoned in the distance by an invisible piper <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Einstein/gchgl_XLqI0C?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=Everything%20is%20determined%2C&pg=PT477&printsec=frontcover">5</a>."</p>

<h1>Rewards, Punishment, Blame, Apologies</h1>
<p>So when you believe in Free-Will, you also believe that you could correct any behavior by utilizing reward & punishment, re-education, and torture. Since you believe everyone is biologically equal, then the only difference between one human and the next must be their internal monologues called mindsets. Criminals adopted a bad mindset. And where did that bad mindset originate? Criminals learned from other criminals by reading manifestos. And so in order to prevent crime, you need to fight propaganda, deplatform. Torture prevents crime, it is a form of re-education. If everytime you drink alcohol, I zap with you electricity, the zap will teach you how to stop drinking alcohol. Violence is justified long as it's for a good cause. If you torture a nazi, he will stop being a nazi. If you torture a homosexual, he will stop being a homosexual. I know not to touch fire, because I know fire hurts. We need to install a chip inside our brains so every time a racist thought enters our brain, the device zaps us with a bolt of electricity, and causes us a great deal of pain.</p>

<p>As a tenent of my pre-determinism philosophy, I strongly oppose rewards, punishment, blame, and apologies. The poor are poor because they are born with adversities. The rich are rich because they are born with privileges. Therefore, it makes no sense to punish the poor for being "lazy." And it makes no sense to reward the rich for being "hard-working." Thomas Edison said "Reward and punishment seems unreasonable."</p>

<p>My favorite atheism quote is by Thomas Edison "He also made the fish I catch and eat. And where do His mercy, kindness, and love for that fish come in? <span aria-hidden="true"><a href="../thomasedison.html">1</a>"</span></p>
