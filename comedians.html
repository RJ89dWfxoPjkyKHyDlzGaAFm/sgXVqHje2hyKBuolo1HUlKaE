<h1>The End of Comedians</h1>
<p>Comedy needs government reform. Would you describe BlackFace as having comedic value? I believe comedy is glorified bullying. Look at 4chan.org, their form of comedy is "Let's kill all n*ggers and k*kes hahaha." I believe we need to punish people who make inappropriate jokes. From now on, you need consent from the person being made fun of, or else you can't call yourself a comedian, then you're just a bully. Bullying causes mass shooters, mass shooters cause world wars. Government regulation of comedy is not a regression of society. Comedy adds nothing of value to any meaningful intelligent conversation. Comedy is leisure time for idiots. Look at Jack Ass, people laugh because men are getting kicked in the balls. We should strive for a society where comedians do not exist anymore, starting... with... <b>Ethan Klein</b>.</p>

<p>For Halloween 2022, Ethan dressed up as Catholic Pedophile Priest <a href="https://youtu.be/dujxYwvPGxA?t=19">1</a>.</p>

<p>Ethan asked artificial intelligence to draw a picture of "The Pope with a shirtless child" <a href="https://youtu.be/VHkpIXco8Ks?t=6768">1</a>.</p>

<p>Ethan got banned from twitter for acting like a pedophile as a "joke" <a href="https://archive.ph/VuJ2M#selection-4471.0-4471.149">1</a>.</p>

<p>Ethan got banned from the Meta-verse for grooming children <a href="https://twitter.com/xStarSwanx/status/1570580567741329411">1</a>.</p>

<p style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255)">The metaverse is a new frontier for trolling. One popular YouTuber named Ethan Klein streamed a session last month when he tried to be as sexually explicit as possible while surrounded by kids in the Plaza.</p>

<p>That's a quote from the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/07/technology/metaverse-facebook-horizon-worlds.html">1</a>.</p>
<p>Ethan said "I love the pornstar Belle Delphine because she dresses up <b>like a child</b> and wears braces <b>on purpose</b> to look as young as possible." <a href="https://youtu.be/gzFnlFgrE2E?t=1260">1</a></p>

<p>Ethan said "I love the streamer Alinity because she has big boobs and <b>kids</b> love watching her boobies" <a href="https://youtu.be/dusJfQYx6l8?t=130">1</a>.</p>

<p>He recently called The Quartering a pedophile <a href="https://youtu.be/BraYUdc3YRo?t=8140">1</a>.</p>

<p>While wearing make-up, Ethan said "Men who wear make-up love to fuck kids <a href="https://youtu.be/OKvP1K2OuLk?t=4614">1</a>,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Frenemies3/comments/yufype/what_the_fuck/">2</a>."</p>

<p>It's disgusting how Ethan describes pedophiles as "he fucks kids bro" similar to how frat boys describe their bestfriends "he fucks bitches bro."</p>

<p>Ethan called Patrice Wilson a pedophile so many times, it ruined his career.</p>
