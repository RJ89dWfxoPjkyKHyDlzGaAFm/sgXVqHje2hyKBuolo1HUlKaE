<p>Perpetrator-on-victim: Black-on-white crime is more prevalent than black-on-black crime. The evidence says blacks are hostile against whites. And whites are nonviolent to blacks. Violent incidents that occured during the 365 days of 2018,</p>
  
<p class="two">black-on-black<br>396,449</p>
<p>black-on-white<br>547,948</p>
    
<p>white-on-black<br>59,777‬</p>
<p>white-on-white<br>2,224,024‬</p>
  
<p>When adjusting for population size, 76.5 percent white and 13.4 percent black, the black-numbers should look like this,</p>
  
<p>black-on-black<br>2,262,930‬</p>
<p>black-on-white<br>3,127,687</p>
  
<p>In other words, black-on-black crime is the same as white-on-white crime. The only difference in the crime rates are that blacks really hate white people.</p>
