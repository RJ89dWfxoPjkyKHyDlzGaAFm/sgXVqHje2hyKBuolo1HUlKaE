<h1>Origin Of Kikes</h1>
<p>Long time ago, jews refused to draw X on legal documents, and drew circles instead, because an X is a cross, and jews hate Jesus Christ. So if you ever saw a circle that means a jew wrote it. In yiddish, circle means “kikel,” hence KIKE.</p>

<h1>Addition Symbol</h1>
<h1>⊥</h1>
<p>Above is the addition symbol in jewish schools, because they hate the cross. That's how jews are, you literally show them a cross, and they start crying.</p>

<h1>Origin Of Chuds</h1>
<p>Chud is a slur russians use to denigrate white people. Now days, the only people who use 'chud' often have Ukraine flags on their twitter bios, and they accuse everyone ELSE of being a russian asset.</p>

<h1>Origin Of Based</h1>
<p>Al-Qaeda is a muslim terrorist organization. Al-Qaeda translates to 'the BASE of islam'. Hence, whenever someone beats up a woman or kills a jew, it is called BASED.</p>
