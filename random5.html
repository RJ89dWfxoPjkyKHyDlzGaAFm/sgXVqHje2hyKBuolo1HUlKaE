<h1>Pregnancy is a choice, according to republicans<br>(Broke boys don't deserve no pussy)</h1>
<p>According to republicans, it is scientifically proven if a woman gets raped, the calcium ionophores of her eggs, and ph of her fallopian tubes changes to prevent pregnancy or induce a miscarriage. For example, when a pregnant monkey sees Leonardo Dicaprio's dick, her conscious mind says "If my baby ain't from Leonardo Dicaprio, I don't want it anymore." And she will consciously induce a miscarriage. This far right conspiracy theory is called Cryptic Female Choice or The Bruce Effect. Basically, during rape, your pussy shrivels up. So if you are pregnant, that means you didn't get raped, because you actually enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Also, when a male spider offers a nuptial gift to a female spider, there is a 70% chance of giving birth, but if a male spider does not provide a nuptial gift, there is only a 43% chance of giving birth. According to the republican scientists <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3813325/">1</a>, female spiders consciously reject the sperm of broke men.</p>

<h1>Skeletons in her vagina</h1>
<p>Another republican conspiracy theory is called Telegony. According to the republican scientists, it is scientifically proven female fruit flies store sperm from all her previous sex partners. In other words, if she ain't a virgin, she ain't wifey material.</p>

<h1>Critical Virginity Theory</h1>
<p>According to Vox.com <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/fVKjzvDVGPs?t=317">1</a>, the egg releases chemicals to lure the sperm, that is how sperm understand where to find the egg. The egg goes on a date with a gang of sperm, they all communicate with chemicals, and the egg selects the sperm who has the best personality. We were not taught this, because of patriarchy in our education system. Science textbooks ignore the female body, they only talk about how awesome the sperm is, they portray the sperm like it's a super hero.</p>

<h1>Movie Tropes</h1>
<p>They say black people always die in movies. Researchers say the black people dying in movies trope isn't real <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731204245/https://blackgirlnerds.com/will-it-get-better-for-black-people-in-the-horror-genre/">1</a>. But in 1934 there was "Motion Picture Production Code <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.umsl.edu/~gradyf/theory/1930code.pdf">2</a>,"</span> a set of rules all movie directors had to follow. It said all movies shall promote honest christian values, have happy endings where good triumphs over evil, and immorality shall always be depicted in an unfavorable way. The only thing it said about black people is that interacial marriages shall never be depicted. The vast majority of the rules were creepy and oddly specific rules about sex. For example, you could not have a man and a woman alone in a bedroom, unless they were married. Inadvertently, they made a rule that said in scary movies, the woman who has sex-before-marriage always gets killed, and the woman who stays a virgin always survives. This is called the Final Girl trope.</p>

<p><img src="images\savior.webp">The above movies are racist because of White Savior Narrative. For example, in the movie Freedom Writers. A white woman walked into a colored neighborhood, and she "rescued" brown people. In reality, she colonized that brown neighborhood, and she whitewashed/assimilated those brown students, exactly like an Indian Boarding school. She rescued brown people as if she were rescuing dogs from an animal shelter. If Freedom Writers wants to stop being racist, they should have a black teacher rescuing some rednecks.<br><br>For example, in the movie Green Book. A racist white man had a change of heart. And because he had a change of heart, he rescued a helpess black man. That is like saying black people are so stupid that they can't live without white people. If this movie wants to stop being racist, they should put a black man overcoming a struggle without a white person being there to rescue him. According to Wikipedia, there are 243 documentary films about the Holocaust <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Holocaust_films#Documentary_films">1</a>, but only 15 documentary films about slavery <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Documentary_films_about_slavery_in_the_United_States">2</a>.<img src="images\elie.avif">source: <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsyYYkbuI3A">1</a></p>

<h1>Voldemort is hate speech, that's why you can't say his name.</h1>
<p>Harry Potter is an allegory for racism. Voldemort's ultimate goal is to holocaust all muggles and establish a wizardly master-race. According to Voldemort, in order to have magical powers, your blood needs to be pure. There is just one problem. Hermione Granger's parents are both muggles. In other words, the idea that blood purity makes you a wizard is pseudoscience. The only reason muggles don't have magical powers is due to internalized oppression, and muggles are not given access to wizard universities.</p>

<h1>Muggles Wuz Kangz N Sh*t</h1>

<p>The truth is everyone has magical powers, but in order to have magic, all you need is faith. Harry Potter suffered childhood neglect which made him desperate to believe in magic. Hermione Granger was bullied for being a nerd which made her desperate to believe in magic. The other muggles don't believe in magic because wizard supremacy rewrote the history books so muggles will never learn their true heritage. And when a muggle accidentally discovers magic, a wizard psychologist tells them "Magic isn't real. You need to drink your medications. You have a mental disorder called Drapetomania."</p>


<h1>Sambia Tribe</h1>
<p>The Sambia tribe who live in Papua New Guinea practice a tradition of forcing 7 year old boys to perform oral sex, and drink the semen of older men. Semen drinking is a "right of passage" into adulthood. According to liberals, forcing children to give blowjobs is a peaceful tradition which white people should learn to love, appreciate, and preserve. According to liberals, blowjobs are not sexual at all to those Sambia boys. It only appears sexual to white people because white people are judgmental. In nature there is no such thing as a right or a wrong way to have sex. 90% of giraffes practice homosexuality. If you put any two animals in a cage, those animals will have sex regardless of gender or age. Animals will have sex even with their own family members. Humans are the only species on Earth who arbitrarily decided certain types of sex is wrong. According to liberals, semen drinking is the Sambia version of a sweet sixteen, or a quinceanera. White people have no right to stop the Sambia semen tradition. Just let them be. If you try to stop the Sambia semen tradition, you are a white supremacist and a nazi.<video controls preload="none">

<h1>Everything is a social construct</h1>
<p>The only reason you are heterosexual is because all your life you were brainwashed into believing homosexuality was a bad thing. And deep down you repressed your innate homosexuality because of the lies systemic oppression created. This below chart says biological sex is a social construct <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/visualizing-sex-as-a-spectrum/">1</a>. The theory of sex being determined by chromosomes was invented by white supremacy who believed sex is binary because the Bible says God created only two sexes called Adam and Eve. Obviously, the Bible is wrong. In 2017, modern science proved there is an unlimited number of genders and sexes. In 2019, science proved there is no sexual orientation gene <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/there-is-no-gay-gene-there-is-no-straight-gene-sexuality-is-just-complex-study-confirms">1</a>,<a aria-hidden="true" href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aat7693">2</a>. There is no straight gene, and there is no gay gene.<img src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/File/051_sad0917MontA3p-01.png"> </p>

<h1>The N word is worse than killing animals.</h1>
<p>The Oxford Union is where the smartest humans on Earth debate topics. Carol Adams gave a speech to the Oxford Union saying white supremacy and misogyny is on the same level as eating meat. They laughed at her face. In 2022, the world's smartest group of humans all agreed veganism is the stupidest ideology.</p>

<h1>In Science We Trust</h1>
<p>An estimated 55 million chinese starved to death during The Great Chinese Famine. So basically china's best scientists asked "How do we grow crops faster?" They did scientific research in Lijiazhai Village <a aria-hidden="true" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/9789004322493_005">1</a>, and came up with the Deep Plowing method. The scientists told the farmers "You must do the Deep Plowing method." The farmers replied "My family has grown crops on this land for hundreds of years, and we strongly oppose the Deep Plowing method. I promise you, the old method works best." The scientists told the farmers "Shut the f*ck up you filthy peasant. You're an idiot. You never went to college. Do the Deep Plowing method or else I will kill you." The farmers replied "Okay, I'll do whatever you say. I love my country." The first few crop cycles were the hugest the country had ever seen. And the scientists said "I f*cking told you so!" The farmers said "You were right about the Deep Plowing method, it really works!" Over the years, the next crop cycle was slightly smaller, and the next was even smaller. And what the scientists never could have predicted is that the Deep Plowing method is terrible in the long term because it damages the soil. And that's how 55 million chinese starved to death because they trusted scientists too much. Or perhaps the scientists aren't to blame, it was the government had high expectations.</p>

<h1>Crocodile Tears</h1>
<p>"Acceptance of Responsibility" is the most racist & mysoginistic law in existence today. It means that if you visibly cry in front of a judge, by law that judge is required to give you a shorter prison sentence because you "demonstrated sincere remorse and therefore are less likely to re-offend." In other words, judges are judging you based on your appearance, manners, and attitude. All you need is to act sad, and say things like "I am deeply ashamed of my actions. I am sorry to the victim, and the victim's family. I deserve whatever punishment is given to me," and you will automatically receive less prison time. If you have two rapists, one rapist says "I'm sorry for my actions" and the other rapist says "That b*tch deserved it." The rapist who said "I'm sorry" will automatically receive less punishment, even for the same exact crime. A white criminal could say "I love golf, fishing, and boating. I am in college. I made a terrible mistake because I was drunk." And the judge will say "I know his apology is sincere because we share similar hobbies, and he reminds me of myself when I was young, and so I will give him less prison time." So basically if a black man walks into court with a bad attitude, he will automatically receive more prison time simply for having a bad attitude. And because whites and blacks have different cultures, whites always perceive blacks as having bad attitudes.</p>

<p>Acceptance of Responsibility causes false confessions when lawyers give plea bargains like "If you confess to everything and plead guilty right now, I promise you will receive less punishment, because the judge sees your remorse. But if you plead Not Guilty, the judge believes you are attempting to get away with murder, and you'll receive more punishment. All the evidence is against you. It's better to just say you're guilty, even if you're not guilty."</p>

<h1>White Devils</h1>
<p>All white people are psychopaths. All of them. There is no such thing as a good white person. Here is proof. Thomas Robertson and Jacob Fracker are two white police officers who participated in many peaceful Black Lives Matter protests holding signs like "Silence Equals Violence <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/us/rocky-mount-capitol-riot-black-lives-matter.html">1</a>." They even danced with black people in solidarity. Less than one year later, the same exact two cops were seen storming the Capitol on January 6 in support of Donald Trump. All white people are racist, especially those who support Black Lives Matter. You should always be suspicious of whites who do and say nice things. White people will only do nice things when they are plotting to steal from you. In this case, they were plotting to steal the election.<video controls preload="none">
