<h1>Is Evil A Social Construct?</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminology#Subcultural">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminology#Subcultural</a></p>
<p>This interesting theory says wars exist because one team believes "We are the good guys" and the other team believes "No, we are the good guys." In other words, no one is evil on purpose. Criminals believe themselves to be the heroes of our society. For example, a robber truly believes "I'm making the world a better place by fixing wealth inequality," a killer truly believes "humanity will improve if I murder Donald Trump," a rapists truly believes "Deep down, women enjoy being raped, I'm giving her what she wants," etc, etc.</p>
<h1>Himba Tribe</h1>
<p>So you know how in America, when a guest visits your home, first thing you do is offer them a drink of water. Well, in Africa, the Himba tribe who live in Namibia, when a guest visits <b>their</b> home, the first thing <b>they</b> do is offer <b>their wife</b>!! They say "Please, have sex with my 9 year old wife, it's rude if you don't!!" The wives do not know they are being raped, because the tribe has never heard of feminism, misogyny, pedophilia, rape, or consent, all those concepts were invented by white civilization. So this opens up a whole can of worms. Should we send a military to whip the tribe until they submit to OUR laws? Or is that white washing their culture? Or is that racism? How will the tribe respond? What if the tribe responds "Stop jewing me!"</p>

<h1>Is Telling A Girl You Have Blue Balls Considered Rape?</h1>
<p>Here in the USA, I know of plenty of women who were raped, but they did not know they were raped, until many years later, you sit down and explain it to them, and suddenly it clicks in their brain. For example, most women do not know 'stealthing' is rape. Also, most craziest of all, I saw a tik-tok trend where a woman said "Today I learned Blue Balls is not real... I realized all my life I was being tricked into having sex... so basically I was raped..." It's literally the same exact situation as the Himba tribe!! Blue Balls is when you tell a woman "If you don't give me sex, my balls will turn painfully blue, and I might be hospitalized."</p>
<h1>Is Begging For A Blowjob Every Time She's On Her Period Considered Rape?</h1>
<p>Another Tik-tok woman said "I told my boyfriend that I was sorry for being on my period, which means I couldn't have sex with him, so instead I promised to give him a blowjob, he replied 'Why are you apologizing to me for something your body does naturally? You are not required to give me a blowjob every time you're on your period, it's always your choice.'" And then the woman concluded that she had basically been raped in all her past relationships because she never knew she could say no.</p>
<h1>Urdu</h1>
<p>According to this article, in Pakistan, in the language Urdu, there is no word for "rape". The closest translation is "He stole from me".</p>

<p><a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=8597">https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=8597</a></p>
<p>Even though the Pakistani don't have a word for rape, every Pakistani woman silently is aware of rape, they communicate the concept of rape silently through body language and contextual clues. It seems like somewhere deep down in every woman's soul is a sense of morality. So this brings up the philosophical question of Universality & Suggestibility.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suggestibility">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suggestibility</a></p>
<h1>Random Tangent: A Sad Story</h1>
<p>My sister breeds French Bulldogs, and my aunt told my sister "Why are you forcing this poor innocent dog to suffer through rape?" And every single adult in my family, both men and women, they all laughed and said "It's not possible for an animal to be raped. Animals are stupid. They don't have language. They do not know what is the concept of rape. They just go by instinct. You are applying a human emotion onto an inanimate object."</p>
<h1>Universality</h1>
<p>The concept of marriage is believed to be "universal", because it <b>seems</b> like every culture in the world has independently discovered the concept of marriage. It <b>seems</b> like there is something 'hard-wired' in every human to celebrate the 'marriage' between man and woman.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_universal">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_universal</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage</a></p>
<h1>Subjective Morality vs Objective Morality</h1>
<p>What if morality is 'hard-wired' in every human. Like what if, even though every culture in the world speaks a different language, what if we all silently speak the same emotions.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_(feral_child)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_(feral_child)</a></p>
<p>It all boils down to God. If God is real, that means morality has a specific definition written in the Bible or in our souls. If God is fake, that means morality is a subjective and socially constructed relative term.</p>
<h1>Suggestibility</h1>
<p>Suggestibility basically means like, is clinical depression real, or are we brainwashed into believing it is real? For example, a man tried to find the secret to happiness, and everytime he asked himself "Am I happy?" he suddenly felt sad, so he realized the secret to happiness is to stop asking yourself "Am I happy?". So what if a psychologist asked you, "are you depressed?" and suddenly you do feel depressed but only because a psychologist introduced you to the possibility that you were depressed, but if you never knew what is depression, you never would feel depression in the first place. It's a contentious philosophical question.</p>
<h1>Are Greeks & Romans White?</h1>
<p>Many white supremacists say "My ancestors are the Greeks & Romans." According to liberal scientists, they say the Greeks & Romans were NOT white. They say whiteness is a social construct invented during the 16th century. Therefore, if you had a time machine, and you asked the Greeks & Romans, "Are you white?", they would not understand what you are describing. The scientists call this phenomenon <i>anachronism</i>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anachronism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anachronism</a></p>
<h1>Are Greeks & Romans Pedophiles?</h1>
<p>In Greek & Roman culture, it was normal for adults to have sex with children. Remember, <i>anachronism</i>. So according to liberal scientists, they say the Greeks & Romans are NOT pedophiles. They say pedophilia is a social construct invented during the 20th century. Therefore, if you had a time machine, and if you asked a Greek & Roman, "Are you a pedophile?", they would not understand what you are describing.</p>

<h1>My Personal Anecdotes (Be Nice)</h1>
<p>When I was a 8 years old, in elementary school, there was a very short asian boy with long shiny perfectly straight bowl cut black hair. So every day that I saw him, I patted him on his head, and I said "Awww you're so cute and adorable, you little midget, I love your hair!" After several days, a teacher yelled at me "Jovanny! Stop touching his hair! He says you've been bullying him!!" I was in complete and utter shock. I didn't understand why I perceived him as my bestfriend but yet he perceived me as a bully.</p>
<p>When I was 13 years old, a black teenager in my class had the name Maleek, so everytime I saw him, I sang the song "Mele Kalikimaka is a wise way to say merry christmas to you". I asked him if he knew that song, and he said "Yeah, from the movie Christmas Vacation." I sang that song to him every day, until finally the teacher yelled at me "Jovanny! Stop singing that song! He says you've been bullying him!!" I was in complete and utter shock. I didn't understand why I perceived him as my bestfriend but yet he perceived me as a bully.</p>

<h1>Table Manners</h1>
<p>So that's why I hate the phrase "Just BE NICE, stop being mean, it's not that complicated!" It IS complicated. I am literally nice to everyone but yet they perceive me as a bully. For example, in America, if you slurp and burp while eating, that is considered disrespectful, but in other countries they see it as a compliment, because it means you are enjoying the food. And supposedly, in America, everyone is always smiling, but in other countries smiling is considered rude and creepy, they're like "Why the fuck are you smiling at me, you creepy motherfucker, are you a serial killer?!".</p>

<h1>Golden Rule</h1>
<p>So that's why I hate the advice "Treat others the way YOU want to be treated." I prefer the advice "Treat others they way THEY want to be treated."</p>
