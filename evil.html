<h1>Is Evil A Social Construct?</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminology#Subcultural">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminology#Subcultural</a></p>
<p>This interesting theory says, no one is evil on purpose. Wars exist because one team believes "We are the good guys" and the other team believes "No, we are the good guys." ALL criminals believe themselves to be a "good guy". For example, a robber truly believes "I am fixing wealth inequality," a killer truly believes "humanity will improve if I kill the president," a rapists truly believes "Deep down, women enjoy being raped, I'm giving her what she wants," etc, etc.</p>
<p>For example, what if Andrew Tate TRULY believes women are inanimate objects. And he is not doing it to be evil. It's just ACTUALLY what he fucking believes!!!</p>
<h1>Random Tangent: A Sad Story</h1>
<p>My sister breeds French Bulldogs, and my aunt told my sister "Why are you forcing this poor innocent dog to suffer through rape?" And every single adult in my family, both men and women, they all laughed and said "It's not possible for an animal to be raped. You are applying a human emotion onto an inanimate object."</p>
<p>Last time, my sister flushed live fishes down the toilet. But today, I think, I realized, my sister is not being evil on purpose. Because, my sister TRULY believes animals are inanimate objects, so all my sister believes is that she is breeding animals, so she can collect money, to give her human children a better life ðŸ˜¢.</p>
<h1>Erotomania</h1>
<p>Erotomania is a mental disorder describing a person who is in love with a celebrity, and believes the celebrity loves them back, and believes the celebrity is sending them secret coded "I love you" messages!!</p>

<h1>Himba Tribe<br>(Okujepisa Omukazendu)</h1>
<p>So you know how in America, when a guest visits your home, first thing you do is offer them a drink of water. Well, in the Himba tribe who live in Namibia, when a guest visits <b>their</b> home, the first thing <b>they</b> do is offer <b>their wife</b>!! They say "Please, have sex with my 9 year old wife, it's rude if you don't!!" The wives do not know they are being raped, because the tribe has never heard of feminism, misogyny, pedophilia, rape, or consent, all those concepts were invented by white civilization. So this opens up a whole can of worms. Should we send a military to whip the tribe until they submit to OUR laws? Or is that white washing their civilization? Or is that racism? How will the tribe respond? What if the tribe responds "Stop jewing me!"</p>

<h1>Is Telling A Girl You Have Blue Balls Considered Rape?</h1>
<p>Here in the USA, I know of plenty of women who were raped, but they did not know they were raped, until many years later, you sit down and explain it to them, and suddenly it clicks in their brain. For example, most women do not know 'stealthing' is rape. Also, most craziest of all, a tik-tok woman said "Today I learned Blue Balls is not real... I realized all my life I was being tricked into having sex... so basically I was raped..." It's almost the same exact situation as the Himba tribe!! Blue Balls is when you tell a woman "If you don't give me sex, my balls will turn painfully blue, and I might be hospitalized."</p>
<p>I know you are thinking, "Jovanny, OBVIOUSLY, that's NOT rape, you are denigrating the word rape." But if you think about it, it's no different than a priest telling women "You must have sex with me, or else you shall burn in eternal hell fire."</p>
<h1>Is Begging For A Blowjob Every Time She's On Her Period Considered Rape?</h1>
<p>A Tik-tok woman said "I told my boyfriend that I was sorry for being on my period, which means I couldn't have sex with him, so instead I promised to give him a blowjob, he replied 'Why are you apologizing to me for something your body does naturally? You are not required to give me a blowjob every time you're on your period, it's always your choice.'" And then the woman concluded that she had basically been raped in all her past relationships because she never knew saying no was an option.</p>
<h1>Urdu</h1>
<p>According to this article, in Pakistan, in the language Urdu, there is no word for "rape". The closest translation is "He stole from me".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1350203">https://www.dawn.com/news/1350203</a></p>

<p>Even though the Pakistani don't have a word for rape, every Pakistani woman is silently aware of rape, they communicate the concept of rape silently through body language and contextual clues. It seems like somewhere deep down in every woman's soul is a sense of morality. So this brings up the philosophical question of Universality.</p>
<h1>Universality</h1>
<p>Every culture in the world, no matter how isolated we are from each other, we all seem to invent the same ideas, over and over again, and nobody knows why. For example, supposedly, every culture in the world has independently discovered the concept of marriage. It <b>seems</b> there is something 'hard-wired' in every human to want to celebrate the 'marriage' between man and woman. So what if morality is 'hard-wired'. What if, even though every culture in the world speaks a different language, what if, we all silently speak the same emotions.</p>

<h1>Are Greeks & Romans White?</h1>
<p>Many white supremacists say "My ancestors are the Greeks & Romans." According to liberal scientists, the Greeks & Romans were NOT white. They say whiteness is a social construct invented during the 16th century. Therefore, if you had a time machine, and you asked the Greeks & Romans, "Are you white?", they would not understand what you are describing. The scientists call this phenomenon <i>anachronism</i>.</p>

<h1>Are Greeks & Romans Pedophiles?</h1>
<p>In Greek & Roman culture, adults ritually had sex with children. Remember, <i>anachronism</i>. So according to liberal scientists, they say the Greeks & Romans are NOT pedophiles. They say pedophilia is a social construct invented during the 20th century. Therefore, if you had a time machine, and if you asked a Greek & Roman, "Are you a pedophile?", they would not understand what you are describing.</p>

<h1>Is Psychology A Social Construct?</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenhan_experiment">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenhan_experiment</a></p>
<p>If you have cancer, a doctor can scan your cells to prove you have cancer. However, if you have clinical depression, there is no physical test to prove it, it's just a doctor asking questions like "How do you feel?" Therefore, many republican scientists believe psychology & mental illnesses are imaginary fake social constructs. A famous scientist did an experiment, where basically he pretended to have schitzophrenia, and he successfully fooled dozens of psyschologists into diagnosing himself with schitzophrenia. If you can trick your psychologist, that means psychology is fucking bullshit!!! Meanwhile, it's fucking impossible to trick a REAL docotor into diagnosing you with CANCER, a real doctor will scan your cells and say "You don't have cancer dude," because CANCER is actually fucking real. Psychology is no different than going to church and a priest diagnoses you with DEMONS.</p>
<h1>Suggestibility</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suggestibility">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suggestibility</a></p>
<p>What if, a psychologist asked you, "are you depressed?" and suddenly you do feel depressed, but only because a psychologist introduced you to the possibility that you were depressed, but if you never knew what is depression, you never would feel depressed in the first place. It's a contentious philosophical question. Suggestibility is like a priest says "There is a ghost in this room!!" and suddenly you actually see a fucking ghost in the room BUT ONLY because a priest brainwashed you.</p>
<h1>Materialism VS Idealism</h1>
<p>I saw on a reddit.com, a person asked "How do we know atoms exist?" and a scientist commented "We don't know anything. The only thing we do know, is the universe behaves AS IF atoms DO exists." Science is a social construct. Evert theory is fake. BUT our fake theories allow us to solve real problems. I guess that's all that matters.</p>
