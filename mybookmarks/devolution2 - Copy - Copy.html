<p>So before you claim that this is "fake news," let me explain something. You think just because someone has black skin that means they are "black." However, 23AndMe is a famous genetic testing company. In 2014, 23AndMe published research that shows the average african-american genome is 73.2% African, 24% European, and 0.8% Native <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/12/genetic-study-reveals-surprising-ancestry-many-americans">[1]</a>. This means african-americans are not "black," they are mixed with European. Meanwhile, the average European-American is 98.6% European. Those are the facts.</p>

<p>The following is a speculation. I believe that real africans from africa are 98.6% african. I used to believe that africans are a subspecies. I do not believe africans are a subspecies anymore. It's scientifically complicated to define what subspecies are. However, the definition I am using is "Are they able to reproduce fertile offspring?" For example, if you breed a donkey with a horse, they will produce a hybrid animal called a mule. Now if you breed a mule with another mule, it's impossible for them to reproduce, since every mule is biologically infertile. The reason why mules are infertile is because donkeys and horses are subspecies, their biology is similar but different enough that together they only reproduce infertile offspring. There are other hybrid animal examples such as Liger, Tigon, or Zonkey.</p>

<p>The fact that a European and an African can reproduce fertile offspring together, that tells me that Africans are not a subspecies. So after hundreds of years, why are africans so underdeveloped? You can read online all about how horrible it is in Africa. Anti-nazi media tells us "White people ruined africa. Whites kidnapped, raped them, and enslaved all africans." So I did research online and learned something crazy. Specifically, I was reading a New York Times in the opinions column it said "The historians John Thornton and Linda Heywood of Boston University estimate that 90 percent of those shipped to the New World were enslaved by Africans and then sold to European traders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html">[2]</a>."</p>

<p>So you might be thinking to yourself "That is fake news. The author is racist." I investigated the historians John Thornton and Linda Heywood. Linda Heywood is african-american, John Thornton is european-american. I couldn't find the exact quote anywhere online. So I went to the digital library. I couldn't find any books by Linda Heywood, but I did find this interesting book by John Thornton titled "Africa and Africans in the making of the Atlantic world, 1400-1680 <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL454363W/Africa_and_Africans_in_the_making_of_the_Atlantic_world_1400-1680?edition=isbn_9780521398640">[3]</a>." I am a very slow reader. So I only read 1 or 2 chapters. I never found proof that John Thornton quoted that for the New York Times opinion article. But I did learn new things from John Thornton.</p>

<p>John Thornton gave an interesting balanced pespective on the African tran-atlantic slave trade. He is a trustworthy source because he tells both sides of arguments. Unlike the television news that only tells "White people destroyed africans." According to John Thornton, anti-nazis argue that africa was a primitive peaceful civilization, that africas economy was rudimentary. One day some Europeans discovered gold in a place called The Gold Coast of Africa. The Europeans were greedy. The Europeans arrived with guns that intimated the peaceful africans. The Europeans already had their own prosperous economy, which gave Europeans an economic advantage in africa. Specifically, Europeans had cheaper prices for resources so much that it destroyed Africa's economy. Africans did not want to purchase from african merchants when it was cheaper to buy from Europeans. This put africa in debt and the only option africa had to pay their debts was to start selling slaves. If Europeans never visited africa, then africans would be advanced today. In 2020, the same is occuring with Amazon.com. Indians don't want to purchase from Indian merchants when it is cheaper to simply purchase from Amazon.com, so India was protesting Jeff Bezos, that Jeff Bezos is doing colonialism and enslavement <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51117315">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>So John Thornton gave his own opinion. John Thornton said that when you look at the real historic merchant books from the 1400s, it is evidential that Africans were purchasing neither food nor survival materials from the Europeans. The only thing Africans were purchasing from the Eurpeans was "novelty items" such as alcohol, mirrors, and guns. So John Thornton inadvertently argues that the slave trade was motivated by greed from both Africans and Europeans.<p>

<p>I did not want to base my research soley on the statements of one historian. That was how I did further research and discovered this interview of Nat Amarteifio stating "But Amarteifio says the Europeans weren’t going out and capturing Africans. They couldn’t — they got sick and died from illnesses like malaria. Some African ethnic groups went into business, warring with other groups so they could capture prisoners they sold as slaves to the Europeans. Amarteifio says they were organized and intentional about it." <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-08-20/willful-amnesia-how-africans-forgot-and-remembered-their-role-slave-trade">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>So it became very clear to me that John Thornton was not some crazy nazi historian. It is a widely known fact that africans captured and sold their own african people. Do you know what I think? I am sick and tired of the media saying that africans are innocent victims and Europeans are evil perpetrators. I just want the truth to be out there. Not lies. I am sick and tired of the media pretending like colored men can't do anything evil.</p>

<p>Going back to my orginal question "After hundreds of years, why are africans so underdeveloped?" After examining a lot of evidence, I created my own theory here. Since africans are not a subspecies, it means they can be just as smart as Europeans. However, I believe that evolution caused the african brain to be genetically unevolved. Here is why. A lot of racist people say "Africans are stupid, they stayed in africa, they never traveled the world, they never invented anything." I believe that some africans did leave africa, moved north and became Europeans evolutionarily through millions of years. The humans who remained in africa did not stay due to unintelligence, instead they became unintelligent because they were drinking dirty filthy water in Africa. The more you travel north like Europe, it begins to snow, and when the snow melted it created rivers with the purest cleanest drinking water. Meanwhile in africa, it never snows there. So the african humans had constant diahrea from the contaminated water. Diahrea causes malnutrition, which causes mental retardation. Over millions of years this mental retardation effected the genetics of africans. Even in 2020 there are millions of africans experiencing constant diahrea from drinking contaminated water.</p>

<p>So you are thinking "Why aren't africans who drink clean water smart?" Well that's how evolution works. For example, scientists argue that the reason modern humans are experiencing an obesity epidemic is because of evolution. For millions of years food was extremely rare, so whenever our ancient acncestors had food, they ate all of it to prepare for days when food was unavailable. The body stored extra calories as fat to prepare for famine. Millions of years later, humans became obese because the body is unconsciously afraid of famines. So how do you fix africans? Well you have to do nonviolent eugenics on them which you can read about here. Basically, there has to be a feminist movement for women to start realizing how their mistakes of breeding with psychopathic men is ruining society. And yeah the feminist movement will try to argue that women don't have to change, it's the men who should change. But I am telling you men only think with their you know whats. So basically the fate of humanity is on women since men are too stupid. Just think about it. Who starts every war? It's biology just read about it here. You can also read about the bonobo monkeys and their matriarchy.</p>
