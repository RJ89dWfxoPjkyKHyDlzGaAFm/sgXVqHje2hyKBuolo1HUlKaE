<p>IdiotStreamers.com was a website created by a person named "King Matt." He claims to be Jewish <a href="https://vimeo.com/382798480">[1]</a>. His backstory is that his wife and son died during a car accident with him as the driver. There are rumors that he was possibly drunk during the accident <a href="https://youtu.be/w9nnrhr6lh0">[1]</a>, he blamed himself for his wife's death, and he sought to undo his guilt by calling people out for their bad personalities. Unfortunately, his website is now deleted from the internet. Only the homepage of his website remains. I am going to describe his website.</p> 

<p>Basically, his website is him exposing live video streamers from a website called MeetMe. MeetMe is combined with other apps like Skout and Plenty of Fish. King Matt is very much like KeemStar. However, King Matt had almost no limits. He straight up posted people's phone numbers and house addresses on his website. This is illegal and called doxxing. His verbose of writing style is very stream of consciousness, it was very difficult to understand the meaning of it. But it seems like he is bullying gay, trans, and the mentally ill. In one video the police shows up at a woman's house. He catfished a woman named Donna Diamond <a href="https://linktr.ee/amyboiss">[1]</a> <a href="https://www.meetme.com/donnadiamond">[2]</a>, and exposed how Donna Diamond had lied to all her fans. Donna Diamond pretended to be single so she could earn money from simps, in reality she had a boyfriend. In Donna Diamond's defence, it is possible she was going to inform her fans as their relationship became more secure and permanent. Supposedly, her boyfriend was this magician Paulvutv <a href="https://www.instagram.com/paulvutv/">[3]</a>. Another story King Matt wrote about is Chris Brown.</p>

<p>I forgot what is his real name. He went by the name Chris Brown because quite literally he hates women. I actually saw Chris Brown's live streams a couple times. He is literally a charming psychopath. He was like a cult leader. Apparently, a woman sent Chris Brown hundreds or possibly thousands of dollars to Chris Brown because she was obsessed with him. Chris Brown kept blocking this woman, but the woman created new accounts. Chris Brown said "She catfished me. Turns out it was a disgusting fat b***h. When you're that ugly you should just kill herself. If you're too weak, you can't kill yourself. Give me your house address, and I will slit your throat. You weak, pathetic, worthless s**t. Haven't you heard of a treadmill. Kill yourself." I heard him say to another woman "Shut the f**k up, I'll slit your throat." However, this woman replied "Yes, daddy." He tells people to kill themselves. He calls people racial slurs, accuses people of being a pedophile. One time I heard him say "I hate homosexuals, they should create a law to execute all of them." He says edgey statements, but I always felt like 50% of it was him being an internet troll.</p>

<p>King Matt had audio recordings of Chris Brown. The audio recording is Chris Brown saying "I feel like killing. I feel like doing a mass shooting. And King Matt ruined my life. I know King Matt is always lurking. I would kill his family, but I don't have to, he already killed his own wife and son in a car accident stupid Jew." Somehow King Matt had figured out where Chris Brown's house address, and Chris Brown's phone numbers. King Matt said "Chris Brown is a low life, he should be in prison for all the bullying he is doing. Threatening to kill people and threatening to do a mass shooting is a crime. I reported Chris Brown to the police. He is going to jail. He got banned from the app. His life is ruined, because he has no life outside of the internet." In retaliation, Chris Brown sent photos of dead Jews from World War 2 concentration camps to King Matt, because King Matt is Jewish. King Matt posted screenshots that Chris Brown was sending stock photos of babies to someone and Chris Brown was telling them "You're a pedophile. Kill yourself. You're catfished. I reported you to the police." King Matt said "He thinks everyone is a pedophile, he is projecting his own feelings."</p>

<p>King Matt found photos of Chris Brown's face. That was the main thing about Chris Brown, Chris Brown had never revealed his face to anyone. Chris Brown's livestream was always just a black screen with only the sound of his voice speaking. Chris Brown had a deep seductive charasmatic mesmerizing voice. That's why women are obsessed with him. Anyways, I always thought Chris Brown was a white man. Everyone thinks Chris Brown is white, because of his voice and accent. But somehow, King Matt found photos of Chris Brown's face. Chris Brown is not white at all. Chris Brown is actually muslim! He speaks arabic! Chris Brown was born in the United States, his parents were born somewhere in the middle east. Somehow, King Matt figured out that Chris Brown was a devoted muslim. I always thought Chris Brown was an alpha male type of person. But here is the craziest part. King Matt exposed that Chris Brown is actually bisexual! All of my opinions change and everything was begininng to make sense why Chris Brown hates gay people. Because of his religion, and because he hates himself for being bisexual, probably because his family would disown him if they ever found out. And I just started to feel sorry for Chris Brown. Somehow, King Matt found out that Chris Brown was a young adult who lives with his parents. </p>
