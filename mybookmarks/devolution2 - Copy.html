<p>So before you claim that this is "fake news," let me explain something. You think just because someone has black skin that means they are "black." However, 23AndMe is a famous genetic testing company. In 2014, 23AndMe published research that shows the average african-american genome is 73.2% African, 24% European, and 0.8% Native. This means african-americans are not "black," they are mixed with European. Meanwhile, the average European-American is 98.6% European. Those are the facts.</p>

<p>The following is a speculation. I believe that real africans from africa are 98.6% african. I used to believe that africans are a subspecies. I do not believe africans are a subspecies anymore. It's scientifically complicated to define what subspecies are. However, the definition I am using is "Are they able to reproduce fertile offspring?" For example, if you breed a donkey with a horse, they will produce a hybrid animal called a mule. Now if you breed a mule with another mule, it's impossible for them to reproduce, since every mule is biologically infertile. The reason why mules are infertile is because donkeys and horses are subspecies, their biology is similar but different enough that together they only reproduce infertile offspring. There are other hybrid animal examples such as Liger, Tigon, or Zonkey.</p>

<p>The fact that a European and an African can reproduce fertile offspring together, that tells me that Africans are not a subspecies. So after hundreds of years, why are africans so underdeveloped? You can read online all about how horrible it is in Africa. Anti-nazi media tells us "White people ruined africa. Whites kidnapped, raped them, and enslaved all africans." So I did research online and learned something crazy. Specifically, I was reading a New York Times in the opinions column it said "The historians John Thornton and Linda Heywood of Boston University estimate that 90 percent of those shipped to the New World were enslaved by Africans and then sold to European traders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html">[2]</a>."</p>

<p>So you might be thinking to yourself "That is fake news. The author is racist." I investigated the historians John Thornton and Linda Heywood. Linda Heywood is african-american, John Thornton is european-american. I couldn't find the exact quote anywhere online. So I went to the digital library. I couldn't find any books by Linda Heywood, but I did find this interesting book by John Thornton titled "Africa and Africans in the making of the Atlantic world, 1400-1680 <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL454363W/Africa_and_Africans_in_the_making_of_the_Atlantic_world_1400-1680?edition=isbn_9780521398640">[3]</a>." I am a very slow reader. So I only read 1 or 2 chapters. I never found proof that John Thornton quoted that for the New York Times opinion article. But I did learn new things from John Thornton.</p>

<p>John Thornton gave an interesting balanced pespective on the African tran-atlantic slave trade. He is a trustworthy source because he tells both sides of arguments. Unlike the television news that only tells "White people destroyed africans." According to John Thornton, anti-nazis argue that africa was a primitive peaceful civilization, that africas economy was rudimentary. One day some Europeans discovered gold in a place called The Gold Coast of Africa. The Europeans were greedy. The Europeans arrived with guns that intimated the peaceful africans. The Europeans already had their own prosperous economy, which gave Europeans an economic advantage in africa. Specifically, Europeans had cheaper prices for resources so much that it destroyed Africa's economy. Africans did not want to purchase from african merchants when it was cheaper to buy from Europeans. This put africa in debt and the only option africa had to pay their debts was to start selling slaves. If Europeans never visited africa, then africans would be advanced today. In 2020, the same is occuring with Amazon.com. Indians don't want to purchase from Indian merchants when it is cheaper to simply purchase from Amazon.com, so India was protesting Jeff Bezos, that Jeff Bezos is doing colonialism and enslavement <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51117315">[4]</a>.</p>
