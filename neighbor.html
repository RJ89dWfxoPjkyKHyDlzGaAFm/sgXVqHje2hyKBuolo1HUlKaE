<p>SWIF= Someone who is a friend or family member.</h1>


<h1>My neighbor is a future mass shooter</h1>

<h1>Part One<br>(Stockholm Syndrome)</h1>

<p>I was sitting on my sofa, minding my own damn business, watching television, drinking soda and chips. Got a knock on my door, a lady was standing there, she told me "Can I please talk to SWIF?" Couple days later, my family is acting secretive. I start asking questions. Turns out the lady who knocked on my door is my neighbor and was being held hostage there for almost two decades. The only thing they told me is this: "She is married, they have children. She isn't allowed to leave the house. She isn't allowed to get a job. Once a month, her husband would steal exactly one outfit from one of those used clothing drop boxes, and those were the only clothes she was allowed to wear, and her husband did not supply her with feminine hygiene products."</p>

<p>They told me "Her son is 12 years old, misbehaving at school, social workers got involved. She is fleeing the country, and she needs help using google to find a bus to mexico." So she is gone now, she left to mexico. But she left her two children here. Her two children, and her former husband are my neighbors, right now.</p>

<h1>Part Two<br>(Flashback to the Party)</h1>
<p>Suddenly, I had a flashback. One or two years ago, my neighbor's hosted a small family party. The next day, they told me "Your uncle almost got in a fist fight with our neighbor. They were drinking beer, and all of a sudden, our neighbor said "I am deeply and madly in love with your sister. On the day her husand dies, I will propose to her." In other words, my neighbor is in love with MY mom!! The same man who was holding a woman hostage, he wants to marry my mom!"</p>

<p>Part Three<br>(End of flashback)</p>
<p>Finally, I told my mom, "Don't you see! This man is crazy! He held a girl hostage! He is abusing his children! He wants to marry you! We have never spoken to this man ever, and the first time we talked to him, he told us that he is in love with you! This is crazy! We have to do something! He's probably has a shrine of you! He is probably molesting his children!" My mother said "There's nothing we can do. Social workers already got involved. They will know what to do next. They have procedures for this." I felt powerless.</p>
