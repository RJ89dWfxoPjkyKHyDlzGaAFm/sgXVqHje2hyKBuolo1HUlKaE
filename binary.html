<h1>Banned For Misogyny</h1>
<p><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7086113528842784046">https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7086113528842784046</a><br>I was watching @kateao4's Tik-Tok video titled "Masculinity Test" and in that video she said "If you want to know if a man is husband material, throw an object at him, if he catches it, that means he has good reflexes, and good genes." And then I thought to myself "Wow she is a really good internet troll. I'm going to troll her back." So I left this comment on her video "Throwing objects at men is domestic violence." And she immediately blocked me! So I created a new Tik-Tok profile, and I watched her old videos, so I was looking for clues on why she blocked me. I found her videos titled "I can pepper spray him <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7083575189719616814">1</a>" and "I feel like punching men <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7081310606191611178">2</a>" and "How to psychologically destroy a man's self esteem <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7086109036017487147">3</a>." Suddenly I realized, she's not an internet troll, she's just a crazy ass karen, and those are her genuine beliefs.</p>

<h1>Alpha Women - Toxic Femininity</h1>
<p>She said "When a man truly loves you, he will move mountains to be with you. Women shall not chase men <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7066879844344171822">1</a>, men must do the chasing <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7081756221035973934">1</a>. Your boyfriend should be at the gym sculpting his mind and body so he can fight off a bear for you <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7067273122373831983">1</a>. True love is when a man loves you, even though you are mentally unstable <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7075776157827730730">1</a>." In the next video, she said "If your boyfriend is acting mentally unstable, dump him, you're not his therapist, charge him for your therapy sessions <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7083185602589478190">1</a>." She said "Only women are allowed to approach me in public. Men are not allowed, or else I will report you for sexual assault <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7085487951546731818">1</a>." She said "If he cheats on you, I'll hold him down, while you mutilate his genitals. That's what best friends are for. This is reparations for misogyny <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7081310606191611178">1</a>,<a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7083575189719616814">2</a>,<a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7064653020142767406">3</a>. Bully him until he kills himself. It's impossible to be sexist against men <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7075419240802569518">1</a>. Misandry does not exist. All men have male privilege." </p>

<p>Finally, she said "Men must follow the sidewalk rule. If he doesn't know about the sidewalk rule, dump him, he's toxic, uneducated, and immature." One user replied "Fun Fact: The sidewalk rule began in victorian england, so that carriages wouldn't splash mud on the lady! üòç"<br><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/3ziikUYi03I">https://youtu.be/3ziikUYi03I</a><br>I'm being holocausted because of my gender...</p>

<h1>Cinderella Complex</h1>
<p>She said "It's scientifically proven, men are happiest when they are protecting women. If you want to make a man fall in love, act afraid during a scary movie, and when he hugs you, he will feel like he is protecting you <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7067616961349373230">1</a>." That's literally what the slaves were taught "Blacks are happiest when they are serving the white race, by serving us, they are serving God." You can watch her religious Tik-Tok "God says I'm allowed to dress like a hoe <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7086872634763349290">1</a>." She thinks men are born to be a prince charming, and women are born to be a cinderella. You can watch her homophobic Tik-tok "There is always an equal amount of men and women, even through two world wars, why is that? The answer is simple. God created gay people <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/6946713318405065990">1</a>." In other words, she thinks heterosexuals are God's chosen people, gays are simply God's after thought, gays are a bi-product of evolution.</p>


<h1>My Coming Out Story</h1>
<p>So that's why now I identify as a non-binary gender fluid person. I'm tired of society telling me I'm a f*ggot because I'm not a tall muscular lumberjack. Everyday women are telling me "Can you hang a picture frame for me? Can you change the oil of my car? Can you install tiles?" I don't know how to do any of those things. Just cause I'm a man, don't make me a construction worker! I won't hold the door for a man or a woman. If a bear was chasing you, survival of the fittest! When the Titanic sinks, I will be the first person on the life-boat, first come, first serve! Every time a man gets killed, they always say "Well, what was he wearing? Was he wearing baggy pants? Did he have tattoos? How were grades in high school?"</p>


<h1>TERF</h1>
<p>@kateao4 is not a real feminist. She is a Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist (TERF). A normal feminist preaches "We must abolish the concept of masculinity and femininity. Gender is a social contruct. There is only one gender, the human gender. We must normalize teaching boys to play with dolls, wear skirts, and express emotions. It's okay for boys to cry. It's okay for girls to ride skateboards." A TERF preaches "Men and women should not switch gender roles, or else bad things will happen." For example, @kateao4 said "Crime is caused when men are too emotional. Real masculinity is when a man has mastered the art of controlling his emotions. <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7087273679171669294">1</a>" In other words, real men should not cry. That's why @kateao4 has so many double standards, because she wants to stop men from acting like women. She wants all men to act like Edward Cullen, her ideal version of masculinity.</p>

<p>Andrew Tate said "I don't feel any emotions when I kill people. From a purely logical stand point, if you are preventing me from acheiving my financial or political goals, I will kill you." Do you think the nazi's were too emotional? <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thetaterules/video/7082024389922917638">https://www.tiktok.com/@thetaterules/video/7082024389922917638</a></p>

<p><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ninja.mommy/video/6938473679030324486">https://www.tiktok.com/@ninja.mommy/video/6938473679030324486</a><br>Another TERF is @ninja.mommy who said "Men and women do not have equal abilities. Each gender has their strength and weaknesses. We are polar opposites, ying & yang, designed to compliment each other. Think equity, not equality." In other words, men and women are a different species. Never send a man to do a woman's job, vice-versa.</p> 

<p class="three">"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." Quote by Karl Marx</p>

<p>Another TERF is Candace Owens who said <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/yxNTcMsULuY?t=300">1</a> "Will Smith is acting like a woman, that's why he can't satisfy Jada Pinkett's primal urge to be with a real man. So that's why Jada Pinkett cheated on Will Smith. Hollywood has a transgender agenda. In fact, GI Jane is a movie about a woman who behaves like a man. Will Smith's son Jaden Smith is a cross dresser. We must fight the gay-pedophile-satanic elites who are trying to destroy masculinity & femininity. The nuclear family unit is the basis of civilization, if you destroy the nuclear family, you destroy civilization."</p>

<p>The nuclear family unit basically means you have to move out of your parent's house, get married, purchase a home in suburbia, and raise a family by age 25, or else you are a failure, and if you get divorced you are also a failure. The scientist Jordan Peterson is a TERF who wants to make sex-before-marriage illegal, and divorcing illegal, with his theory called "Enforced Monogamy." His theories are backed by science and God.</p>

<p>The most extreme form of TERF idealogy comes the author of "Hard Times Create Strong Men" Stefan Aarnio who said <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/mt7XVqkrFKg">1</a> "Women are hardwired for hypergamy. Biologically, women have high standards, they only wants to date high status men. A woman who earns $50,000 only wants to date men who earn $100,000. High achieving women feel like no man is good enough for her, so she refuses to settle down, she turns into a spinster, and now the whole world is sexually frustrated, which creates violence. The solution to violence is we need to ban women from the workplace, and ban women from colleges. Women should not work nor be educated. Women are happiest when they are at home raising children." Believe it or not, but many women agree with this philosophy.</p>

<p>Orthodox jewish women are not allowed to leave their homes, nor be educated, they are forced to cook, clean, and do laundry, and the women say "I'm not oppressed. Nobody forces me to do this. I do it for God."<br><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/FKplabTRuak?t=1109">https://youtu.be/FKplabTRuak?t=1109</a></p>

<p>In afghanistan, by law, women are forced to wear hijabs, and this woman said "I'm not forced to wear this. I do it God."<br><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ninja.mommy/video/6892101070269500674">https://www.tiktok.com/@ninja.mommy/video/6892101070269500674</a></p>

<p>Nuns yell at their own daughters "Cover yourself! Wear your hibab! You filthy slut! Burn in hell!" They do it for God.<br><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=331653795494994">https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=331653795494994</a></p>

<p>This woman is advocating to make birth control pills illegal <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://linktr.ee/Taylorgossett">1</a>.<br><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@getrealgirlfriend/video/7095186204991278379">https://www.tiktok.com/@getrealgirlfriend/video/7095186204991278379</a></p>

<p>And this other woman is adovcating to make porn illegal.<br><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fightthebeastorg/video/6995277372165606662">https://www.tiktok.com/@fightthebeastorg/video/6995277372165606662</a><br>All her videos got banned for hate speech <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://fightthebeast.org/blogs/news/the-malicious-intentsd-of-tiktok">1</a>. I wish I had archived some of her videos, she had dozens. I swear to fucking God dude. In one video she said "I'm tired of all these faggots. I need a REAL man to fuck me hard in my pussy. Make america great again, ya'll, let's bring back the death penalty, round up all these OnlyFans women and holocaust them." I swear to fucking God. I saw her live stream, and I asked her "Are you trying to make porn illegal?" She replied "In the 1600s, the puritans used to torture people. Ah, those were the good old days." I hate to put her on blast, but you know, everything on my website is a lie anyway. These days her speeches are less crazy, cuz she got banned so many times. I remember in one video, she was arguing with an OnlyFans girl, and she said "I could do porn, and become a millionaire overnight if I wanted to. But I won't do that. Do you know why? Because I have morals. I love God more than anything. I respect for myself. You're just a filthy gold digging slut." I swear to God dude. Just watch her videos. Also <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ccx5ZnMtAvR/">1</a>, she claims to have gone 1,195 days without masturbation, sex, or any form of orgasm. She does it for God. And she will never settle down for a man who watches porn or masturbates. But yet she has 3 children, I think they are all from different fathers, I don't remember. But her backstory is her father was addicted to porn, and every boyfriend or husband she's every had was addicted to porn, so now she hates porn, wants to kill sluts, she says porn is destroying families, and society is collapsing because of porn.</p>

<p>Many TERFS claim to support LGBT, but yet they think of gays in terms of tops vs bottoms, binary terms to describe non-binary people. Like they think in every gay relationship one person must role play as a man, and the other must role play as a woman. This is transphobic because it excludes non binaries like me who identify as neither male nor female.</p>

<p>If I say one bad thing about women, women will tell me "You're just a little faggot who can't get laid." That's literally what @kateao4 told someone <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7080581573657070890">1</a>. I'm telling you, she is transphobic. She thinks just because I am a man, that I'm supposed to have sex. Truly, my only dream in life is I just want world peace. World peace is more important than sex. I would stay a virgin forever in exchange for world peace. STFU you stupid ass racist TERF, all you want is a big fat diamond ring, all I want is world peace, you're not on the same level as me.</p>

<p>You think men are fragile? Women are so fragile they banned "Thigh Gap" from Tik-Tok ü§Æ.</p>
