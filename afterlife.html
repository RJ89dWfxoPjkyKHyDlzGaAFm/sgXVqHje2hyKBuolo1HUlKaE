<h1>Spoilers</h1>
</p>The movie reviews are negative because its critics failed to understand the plot. This is a movie you need to watch twice to understand. The first time you watch it, you will think it's a stupid movie about the supernatural. I am going to tell you what the movie is really about. </p>
   
<p>This movie is about a serial killer who only murders either depressed or suicidal people. The serial killer has killed many victims but this movie mainly tells the story of just one victim. The victim is a depressed woman.</p>
