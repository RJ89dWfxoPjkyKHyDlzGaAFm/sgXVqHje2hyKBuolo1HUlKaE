<h1>Spoilers</h1>
</p>The movie reviews are negative because its critics failed to understand the plot. This is a movie you need to watch twice to understand. The first time you watch it, you will think it's a stupid movie about the supernatural. I am going to tell you what the movie is really about. </p>
   
<p>This movie is about a serial killer who only murders either depressed or suicidal people. The serial killer has killed many victims but this movie mainly tells the story of just one victim. The victim is a depressed woman. The instant the serial killer met this woman, he immediately sensed her depression. The serial killer started stalking the woman. The serial killer added an electronic device to the woman's car. The tool was a hacking device that allowed the serial killer full remote control over her vehicle. One night the woman was driving on the freeway, the serial killer used his remote control to sabotoge the woman's breaking system, causing the woman to be involved in a car accident. The serial killer stepped out of his own car, he held a phone to his ears pretending like he was calling the police. The serial killer stabbed the woman's neck with a needle containing a mysterious drug that makes her body appear deceased.</p>

<p>The woman is presumed dead and taken to a mortician. The mortician is the serial killer. The serial killer injects different drugs on the woman's body that causes amnesia, hallucinations, unconciousness, vivid dreams, slow metabolism, or anaesthesia. During the woman's drug induced hallucinations, the serial killer attempted to convince the woman that she is dead, and that the serial killer has a supernatural perception of souls who are transitioning into the death realm; so that is how they are able to communicate even though she is dead. The serial killer created this lie because he wants to hear the woman's confession that she is happier now that she is dead. This way the serial killer is certain that he is killing a suicidal person, and not just a random girl.</p>

<p>The woman is locked inside of the serial killer's basement. The woman doesn't believe that she is dead. The woman does multiple failed escape attempts. Now the serial killer is doubtful that the woman was ever suicidal. The serial killer concludes that people who are in love are probably not suicidal. The serial killer asks "Were you truly in love with your boyfriend?" The woman says "That is non of your business." From the beginning of the movie, we know the woman was unhappy in her relationship, the woman was finding every excuse to breakup with her boyfriend. </p>

<p>Eventually the woman believes that she is dead. The woman falls asleep and dreams that her boyfriend was asking her "Do you love me?" In that dream sequence the woman didn't respond to the question. When the dream is over, the woman said "Is it always like this? I thought that when you died you wouldn't feel any more pain. You wouldn't have to struggle anymore. But it just never stops does it?" The woman continues describing her depression like this "I have so many regrets. I have nothing but regrets. I wanted a different life. I tried. Nothing ever seemed to change. I woke up everyday. I took a shower. Drove in the same traffic to work. Went home. Went to sleep. Woke up again. Nothing was ever different. I wanted to be happy. I don't know. I just want it to be over. I wanted love. You don't understand. I wanted to love. I was too scared. My mother, when I was little I learned that loving someone meant getting hurt. So I decided not to love anyone. So I'd never get hurt. I kept pushing my boyfriend away. He thought I didn't love him. He was the only one I loved. But I could never say it." The serial killer was unimpressed.</p>

<p>The serial killer says "What would you do if you had a second chance?" He unlocked and opened the door, gesturing towards it, and said "Well isn't this what you wanted?" The serial offers the woman an opportunity to escape the basement and run back to her boyfriend. The woman declined his offer by saying "I'm glad I'm dead. I'm glad it's over." The woman isn't depressed because of a relationship, her unhappy relationship was only a symptom of her depression deeply rooted since childhood. Now that the woman confessed that she is suicidal, the woman chose to stay in the serial killer's basement where she believes it will bring her to the After Life. </p>

<p>Meanwhile all of this is happening, there is a child-boy constantly visiting the serial killer's funeral house. The boy has nowhere else to go. The boy's father was never shown. The boy resides with only a single mother. The boy's mother is so depressed that all she does is watch Television everyday neglecting the boy. Since the boy is neglected, afterschool everyday the boy goes to the funeral house.</p>

<p>The serial killer has conversations with the boy. The boy asks questions and the serial kiler responds with theories. The serial killer confessed to the boy that the first victim he buried was the serial killer's own mother who suffered from depression. The serial killer explains to the young boy that the world is afflicted from people who are not living their best lives. These depressed humans make the world miserable for others, like how the serial killer's mother neglected him because of depression, burying these people is like removing feces and carbon emissions. The serial killing teaches the boy how to be a serial killer.</p>
