<h1>Plot Spoilers</h1>
<p>I am going to spoil the plot of a movie called After.Life (2009) starring Liam Neeson. Now, you think you just witnessed a paranormal movie. You're wrong. What you really watched is a movie about a mortician who is also a serial killer and only kills people who are depressed. The reason he only murders depressed people is because his mother had depression. Her depression caused her to neglect her child. And when the child grew up, he became a serial killer who only murders depressed people. Here is the proof.

<p>Before Anna died, we saw a white van.</p>

<p>Later, we learned Liam Neeson drives a white van.</p>

<p>When Anna's boyfriend died, we saw a white van.</p>

<p>You can see Anna's breath in the mirror. This means Anna is not a ghost. She is a real living breathing human.</p>

<p>You can see Liam Neeson is holding Hydronium Bromide.</p>

<p>Later in the movie, a cop said criminals could theoretically use Hydronium Bromide to make the living appear dead.

<h1>The Test</h1>

<p>So there you have it. Liam Neeson is a serial killer. In order to complete his serial killer ritual, he wants to feel the satisfaction of knowing he selected his victims correctly. He created a "depression litmus test" where he tells them "You died. You're a ghost. Only I can see you. I have a gift of seeing ghosts. And I want to ask you something. When was the last time you felt happiness?"

<h1>The Kid</h1>
<p>Through out the movie, a kid is wandering the streets alone. Why is a kid riding his bike alone at night? It's because the kid is neglected.</p>

<p>The kid's mother has depression. She watches television all day to numb her sadness away. She gave up on life. Her depression caused her to neglect her son.</p>

<p>That explains why the kid's mother looks like a corpse. Whenever someone has depression, Liam Neeson and the kid perceive them as having zombie features. And that's how Liam Neeson and the kid select their victims. They search for walking corpses. In one scene, Liam Neeson told the kid "The first ghost I ever saw was my very own mother." Liam Neeson murdered his own mother because he hated her depression, and now Liam Neeson wants the kid to do the same. Liam Neeson is teaching this kid how to be a serial killer. During the graveyard scene, Liam Neeson told the kid "I'm the only one who can see all these corpses. Wandering around aimlessly, all they do is piss and shit, suffocating us with their stench, doing nothing with their lives, taking the air away from those who actually want to live. I have to bury them all. I have no choice. Now there's two of us." In the end, the kid saw a chicken had depression, and so the kid buried the chicken alive, and the chicken died.</p>
