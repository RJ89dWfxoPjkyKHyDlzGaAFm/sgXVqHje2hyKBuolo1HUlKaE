<h1>Spoilers</h1>
</p>The movie reviews are negative because its critics failed to understand the plot. This is a movie you need to watch twice to understand. The first time you watch it, you will think it's a stupid movie about the supernatural. I am going to tell you what the movie is really about. </p>
   
<p>This movie is about a serial killer who only murders either depressed or suicidal people. The serial killer has killed many victims but this movie mainly tells the story of just one victim. The victim is a depressed woman. The moment the serial killer met this woman, he instantly sensed her depression. The serial killer started stalking the woman. The serial killer added an electronic hacking tool to the woman's car. The tool was a hacking device that allowed the serial killer full remote control over her vehicle. One night the woman was driving on the freeway, the serial killer used his remote control to sabatoge the woman's breaking system, causing the woman to be involved in a car accident. The serial killer stepped out of his own car, he held a phone to his ears pretending like he was calling the police,    </p>
