<h1>Harry Potter</h1>
<p>I see that you like so many before you have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself exactly as he is. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest and most desperate desires of our hearts. This mirror gives us neither knowledge nor truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. It does not due to dwell on dreams and forget to live. </p>
