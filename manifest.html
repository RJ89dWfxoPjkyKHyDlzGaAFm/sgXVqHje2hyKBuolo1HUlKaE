<p>It is my duty to share this racist manifesto on my website because though you strongly oppose racist beliefs, in the end this manifesto will improve your intelligence from understanding the opinion of your enemies. Having this on my website does not mean I am in agreement with it. I simply am a person who strongly believes in freedom of speech. There is a boundary where freedom of speech is criminal, and that boundary is when someone says for example "I command my followers to do {insert crime] on {time/date} at {location}." The other boundary where freedom of speech is criminal is much more challenging to define, and that is misinformation. Does this manifesto constitute misinformation? I don't believe this manifesto is misinformation. </p>
