 <h1>DRAFT</h1>
<p>preface: I am Chicano-American. My spiritual denomination is I am atheist. I completely deny the existence of God or Gods. My philosphical denomination is called Determinism which means that I believe humans do not have free-will. Albert Einstein and Thomas Edison believed in determinism hypothesis. My political denomination is unaffiliated. I do not believe politics will have any meaningful effect on society. My political motto is "Do not create new laws, instead create a transformation in the heart and minds of people." </p>
  
<p>It is my duty to share this racist manifesto on my website because though you strongly oppose racist beliefs, in the end this manifesto will improve your intelligence from understanding the opinion of your enemies. Having this on my website does not mean I am in agreement with it. I simply am a person who strongly believes in freedom of speech. There is a boundary where freedom of speech is criminal, and that boundary is when someone says for example "I wish that someone would do {insert crime} on {time/date} at {location}." There is another boundary where freedom of speech is criminal, and that is much more challenging to define is misinformation. Does this manifesto constitute misinformation? I don't believe this manifesto is misinformation, since it offers legitimate evidence from books and research papers.<p>
 
<p>For example, the majority of scholars are in agreement that statistically Native-Africans are less intelligent than White Europeans, however on the explanation of why, there is a scholarly debate. The Racist will argue "This intelligence test proves my theory that Africans are a humanoid subspecies. Genetic anomolies causes low-intelligence. And low-intelligence causes poverty." The Anti-Racist will argue "This intelligence test proves my theory that Africans are institutionally oppressed. Institutional oppression causes unequal opportunities. And unequal opportunities causes low-intelligence."</p>
 
<p>You are angry at the idea of describing Africans as a humanoid subspecies. However, the word subspecies in science is neither political nor derogatory. Europeans, Asians, and Africans are different types of humanoid subspecies <a href="https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/212169298-23andMe-Reference-Populations-Regions">[1]</a>. Some prefer the term genetic-cluster instead of subspecies.</p>
 
<p>Every day we hear words such as left wing, right wing, democrat, republican, liberal, fascist, communist, and socialist. These terms are nonsense. 
<p>Here below is an intuitive system for understanding politics.</p>
 
<h1>Literal and Figurative Christianity</h1>
<p>Literal Christians are those who interpret their bible literally. They believe their bible was written by God and bestowed onto Moses; therefore their bible is flawless. They believe their bible is a true retelling of historical events. Some deny human evolution hypothesis. Others embrace evolution as being God's way of inventing life.</p>  
 
<p>Figurative Christians are those who interpret their bible figuratively. They believe their bible was written by humans with inspiration from God; therefore their bible contains human errors. They believe their bible is a metaphor. This is how figurtive christians can choose to ignore several bible verses. For example gay christians could argue that humans misintreptred God's message.</p>

 <h1>Determinism and Non-Determinism</h1>
 <p>Non-Determinists: The human brain is controlled by the conscious mind. Since you have complete control over your conscious mind, it means your destiny is prescribed by you.</p>
 
 <p>Determinism: The human brain is controlled by the unconscious mind. Since you have no control over your unconcious mind, it means your destiny is prescribed by nature. </p>
