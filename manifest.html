<p>It is my duty to share this racist manifesto on my website because though you strongly oppose racist beliefs, in the end this manifesto will improve your intelligence from understanding the opinion of your enemies. Having this on my website does not mean I am in agreement with it. I simply am a person who strongly believes in freedom of speech. There is a boundary that could get crossed in freedom of speech, and that boundary is when someone says for example "I command my followers to do {insert crime] on {time/date} at {location}."</p>
