<p>It is my duty to share this racist manifesto on my website because though you strongly oppose racist beliefs, in the end this manifesto will improve your intelligence from understanding the opinion of your enemies. Having this on my website does not mean I am in agreement with it. I simply am a person who strongly believes in freedom of speech. There is a boundary that could get crossed in freedom of speech, and that boundary is when someone says for example "I command my followers to do {insert crime] on {time/date} at {location}."</p>
     
<p>If you think you can just delete this manifesto from the interent and that's all it would take to end racism, you are incorrect. By deleting everything racist from the internet, you are only forcing racist people to move the conversation into the Deep Dark Web where not even the U.S. government can read their IP addresses. This manifesto does not promote violence. If you think it promotes violence, you sound as stupid as those people who say video games causes violence. Do video games cause violence? I don't know. That is another interesting discussion.</p>
   
<p> That is why it is important that these difficult conversations should remain on the World Wide Web where authories could identify user IP addresses.</p>
