<p>This is racist manifesto called The Nationalist. It was written by a random person on /pol/, who probably lives in his grandma's basement. I am paranoid that Google or my web host is going to randomly delete my website. but like whatever. For all we know the author of The Nationalist is an internet troll who created it as a form of art. I doubt it.</p> 
   
<p>It is my duty to share this racist manifesto on my website because though you strongly oppose racist beliefs, in the end this manifesto will improve your intelligent from understanding the opinion of your enemies. Having this on my website does not mean I am in agreement with the manifesto. I simply am a person who strongly believes in freedom of speech. I hate cancel culture. For example, if you wanted to, you can read this manifesto and write your own anti-manifesto that debunks this one.</p>
   
 <p>If you think you can just delete this manifesto from the interent and that's all it would take to end racism, you are incorrect. By deleting everything racist from the internet all this would do is make racist people go onto the deep dark web where not even the U.S. government can read their IP addresses. This manifesto does not promote violence. If you think it promotes violence, you sound as stupid as those people who say video games causes violence.</p>
   
 <p>There is a boundary that could get crossed in freedom of speech. The boundary is when someone says for example "I command my followers to do {insert crime] on {time/date} at {location}." That is why it is important that these difficult conversations remain on the World Wide Web where authories could identify your IP address.</p>
