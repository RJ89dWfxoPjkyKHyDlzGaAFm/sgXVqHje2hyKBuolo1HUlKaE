<p>It is my duty to share this racist manifesto on my website because though you strongly oppose racist beliefs, in the end this manifesto will improve your intelligence from understanding the opinion of your enemies. Having this on my website does not mean I am in agreement with it. I simply am a person who strongly believes in freedom of speech. There is a boundary where freedom of speech is criminal, and that boundary is when someone says for example "I wish that someone would do {insert crime] on {time/date} at {location}." There is another boundary where freedom of speech is criminal, and that is much more challenging to define is misinformation. Does this manifesto constitute misinformation? I don't believe this manifesto is misinformation, since it offers legitimate evidence from books and research papers. For example, the majority of scholars are in agreement that African-Americans are less intelligent than Whites, however on the explanation of why, there is a scholarly debate. The Racist will argue "This proves my theory that African-Americans are a subspecies. Genetic differences causes low-intelligence. And low-intelligence causes poverty." The Anti-Racist will argue "This proves my theory that African-Americans are judicially oppressed. Oppression causes unequal opportunities. And unequal opportunities causes low-intelligence."</p>
