 <h1>DRAFT</h1>
<p>preface: I am Chicano-American. I am atheist. I completely deny the existence of God or Gods. My philosphical denomination is Determinism which means that I believe humans do not have free-will. Albert Einstein and Thomas Edison believed in determinism hypothesis. My politics is unaffiliated. My political motto is "Do not create new laws, instead create a transformation in the heart and minds of people." </p>
  
<p>It is my duty to share this racist manifesto on my website because though you strongly oppose racist beliefs, in the end this manifesto will improve your intelligence from understanding the opinion of your enemies. Having this on my website does not mean I am in agreement with it. I simply am a person who strongly believes in freedom of speech. There is a boundary where freedom of speech is criminal, and that boundary is when someone says for example "I wish that someone would do {insert crime} on {time/date} at {location}." There is another boundary where freedom of speech is criminal, and that is much more challenging to define is misinformation. Does this manifesto constitute misinformation? I don't believe this manifesto is misinformation, since it offers legitimate evidence from books and research papers.<p>
 
<p>For example, the majority of scholars are in agreement that statistically Native-Africans are less intelligent than White Europeans, however on the explanation of why, there is a scholarly debate. The Racist will argue "This intelligence test proves my theory that Africans are a humanoid subspecies. Genetic anomolies causes low-intelligence. And low-intelligence causes poverty." The Anti-Racist will argue "This intelligence test proves my theory that Africans are institutionally oppressed. Institutional oppression causes unequal opportunities. And unequal opportunities causes low-intelligence."</p>
 
<p>You are angry at the idea of describing Africans as a humanoid subspecies. However, the word subspecies in science is neither political nor derogatory. Europeans, Asians, and Africans are different types of humanoid subspecies <a href="https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/212169298-23andMe-Reference-Populations-Regions">[1]</a>. Some prefer the term genetic-cluster instead of subspecies.</p>
 
<p>Every day we hear words such as left wing, right wing, democrat, republican, liberal, fascist, communist, and socialist. These terms are nonsense. 
<p>Here below is an intuitive system for understanding politics.</p>
 
<h1>Literal and Figurative Christianity</h1>
<p>Literal Christians are those who interpret their bible literally. They believe God wrote the bible and bestowed it perfectly onto Moses; therefore the bible is flawless. They believe their bible is a true retelling of historical events. Some deny human evolution hypothesis. Others embrace evolution as being God's way of inventing life.</p>  
 
<p>Figurative Christians are those who interpret their bible figuratively. They believe the bible was written by humans with inspiration from God; therefore their bible contains human errors. This is how figurative christians can choose to ignore several bible verses. For example gay figurative christians could argue that humans misrepresented God's message.</p>

 <h1>Determinism and Non-Determinism</h1>
 <p>Non-Determinism: Your body is being controlled by your decisions. You can choose to feel sad or you can choose to feel happy. You decide what to do with your life. You can decide to be a rich billionaire, or you can decide to be homeless. It all depends on whether you decide to be lazy or decide to not be lazy. You can choose to be homosexual, or you can choose to be straight. You decide your destiny.</p>
 
 <p>Determinism: Your body is being controlled by a math equation called Big Bang theory or God's Plan. Human consciousness is an electrical impulse in our brains which we have no control of the electricity. Somewhere in the math equation there is an inscription called the story of your life. The math equation is like a really long book that contains so many pages that it is not possible for a human to read all of it. Some humans tried reading pages of the math equation and it became the study of the laws of natural physics and quantum mechanics. </p>
