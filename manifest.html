<p>preface: I am Chicano-American. My spiritual denomination is I am an atheist. I completely deny the existence of God or Gods. My philosphy denomination is called Determinism which means that I believe humans do not have free-will.</p>
  
<p>It is my duty to share this racist manifesto on my website because though you strongly oppose racist beliefs, in the end this manifesto will improve your intelligence from understanding the opinion of your enemies. Having this on my website does not mean I am in agreement with it. I simply am a person who strongly believes in freedom of speech. There is a boundary where freedom of speech is criminal, and that boundary is when someone says for example "I wish that someone would do {insert crime} on {time/date} at {location}." There is another boundary where freedom of speech is criminal, and that is much more challenging to define is misinformation. Does this manifesto constitute misinformation? I don't believe this manifesto is misinformation, since it offers legitimate evidence from books and research papers.<p>
 
<p>For example, the majority of scholars are in agreement that statistically Native-Africans are less intelligent than White Europeans, however on the explanation of why, there is a scholarly debate. The Racist will argue "This intelligence test proves my theory that Africans are a humanoid subspecies. Genetic anomolies causes low-intelligence. And low-intelligence causes poverty." The Anti-Racist will argue "This intelligence test proves my theory that Africans are institutionally oppressed. Institutional oppression causes unequal opportunities. And unequal opportunities causes low-intelligence."</p>
 
<p>You are angry at the idea of describing Africans as a humanoid subspecies. However, the word subspecies in science is neither political nor derogatory. European, Asian, African, are all subspecies <a href="https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/212169298-23andMe-Reference-Populations-Regions#h_7bf7e722-76e2-4a6a-a5f4-11324ff018f2">[1]</a>.</p>
 
<p>You are erroneously associating Anti-Racism with socialism economy, and Racism with capitalism economy. The truth is that Racism can support both socialism and capitalism. For example, according to Racism Hypothesis, African societies are unable to prosper since genetics has cursed their unintelligent brains; this means a universal basic income and social welfare programs are neccessary for helping impoverished civilizations whose brains are cursed by genetics.</p>
 
 <p>No person wants to that they are too stupid
