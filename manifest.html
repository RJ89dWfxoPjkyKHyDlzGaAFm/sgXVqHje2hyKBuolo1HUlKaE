 <h1>DRAFT</h1>
 <p>preface: These are the fundamental reasons why people have disagreemts.</p>
 
<h1>Literal and Figurative Christianity</h1>
<p>Literal Christians are those who interpret the Christian bible literally. They believe God wrote the bible and bestowed it perfectly onto Moses; therefore the bible is flawless. The King James bible is the only bible that has God's blessing, all other translations are blasphemous. They believe the bible is a true retelling of historical events. Some deny human evolution hypothesis. Others embrace evolution as being God's way of inventing life. </p>  
 
<p>Figurative Christians are those who interpret their bible figuratively. They believe the bible was written by humans with inspiration from God; therefore their bible contains human errors. This is how figurative christians can choose to ignore several bible verses. For example gay figurative christians could argue that humans misrepresented God's message. Figurtive Christians can sometimes deny Jesus and the bible. Church is not necessary for salvation. Salvation arises from within. There is only one message in the bible that truly matters, "God is love." </p>

 
<h1>Freedom of Choice</h1>
<p>Free Will Exists</p>
<p>Example: Non-Determinism: Your body is being controlled by your decisions. You can choose to feel sad or you can choose to feel happy. You decide what to do with your life. You can decide to be a rich billionaire, or you can decide to be homeless. It all depends on whether you decide to be lazy or decide to not be lazy. You can choose to be homosexual, or you can choose to be straight. You decide your destiny.</p>
<p>Example: {insert-a-crime}: Criminals do bad things because they made the wrong decisions in life. Criminals are being propagandized by other criminals into adopting harmful mindsets. In order to stop crime, you need to educate criminals into adopting healthier mindsets. No person is born {racist}, {racism} is a learned behavior. The formula is simple, humans + {racist} propaganda = {racist}-humans. In order to stop the existence of {racist} humans, all you need to do is stop giving {racist} propagandists a platform for sreading their harmful belief systems. Delete {racist} internet memes. Delete {racist} manifestos.</p>
 
<p>Free Will Does Not Exist</p>
<p>Example: Your body is being controlled by a math equation called Big Bang theory or God's Plan. A+B=C. A and B is a cause. C is an effect. There are no random effects in the universe, there are only pseudorandom effects whose causes are variables unknown to mankind. Every event in the universe was determined by math equations of the laws of physics and quantum mechanics. Human consciousness is an electrical impulse in our brains which we have no control of the electricity. Life is like a book where every event is known by God but the characters in the book don't know what is going to happen next. But no matter what the characters are thinking, they are always going to do whatever the book said they are supposed to do. The language of our universe is mathematics, and in mathematics one-way-functions do not exist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function">[2]</a>; this means nothing is random in our universe. In computer science, "one-way-functions" are utilized to generate "random" numbers; but those numbers are not random, only the numbers are cryptographically secure <a href="https://www.random.org/">[3]</a>. Random in our universe simply means humans don't know the pattern. For example, a supercomputer is helping scientists find a cure for coronavirus, because scientists know; just like everything in our universe, the coronavirus is a solvable math equation <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2020/09/05/a-supercomputer-analysed-data-on-covid-19-and-helped-come-up-with-this-new-hypothesis">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>Free Won't</p>
<p>Your body is telling you to do bad things but you have the decision to not do what your body is telling you to do. This is called Libet's Experiment of Free Will <a href="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lmI7NnMqwLQ?start=849">[5]</a></p>

<h1>Coin Flip Analogy</h1>
<p>Everytime you flip a coin, you think it will be either heads or tails and it's completely random. Truth is the Coin Flip experiment is not random at all. If you only knew the exact force and velocity of every molecule in the universe, you would be able to predict which side the coin will land on; the same as how scientists can predict when is the next solar eclipse. If you only knew the exact force and velocity of every molecule in the universe, your body, and your brain; you would be able to predict what ideas you will have and what decision you will choose.</p>
