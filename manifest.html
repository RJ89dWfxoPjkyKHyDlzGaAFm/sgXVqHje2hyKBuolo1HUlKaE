<p>This is racist manifesto called The Nationalist. It was written by a random person on /pol/, who probably lives in his grandma's basement. Having this on my website doesn't mean I am in agreement with the manifesto. I simply am a person who strongly believes in freedom of speech. I hate cancel culture. I am paranoid that Google or my web host is going to randomly delete my website. but like whatever. For all we know the author of The Nationalist is an internet troll who created it as a form of art. I doubt it.</p> 
   
<p>It is my duty to share the manifesto on my website because even if you strongly hate racist idealogies, in the end it will make you even more intelligent from understanding the opinion of your enemies.</p>
