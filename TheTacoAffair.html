<p>I am reasonably confident that this is the suspect's photo <a href="https://archive.ph/eDgzn">1</a>. Because, it looks eerily similar to his reddit avatar. The photo comes from a facebook called "Taco Pahua" and the only thing it liked is "Houston Museum of Natural Science", more on that later.</p>
