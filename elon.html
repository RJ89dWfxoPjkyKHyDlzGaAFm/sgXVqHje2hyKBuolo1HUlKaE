<h1>ELON MUSK</h1>
<p>According to Craig Daniel Mansfield, if you click on the twitter hashtags #s2r, #megalinks, #megatrade, #dropboxlinks, it will take you to child porn.</p>

<p>I clicked on the #s2r. I saw a long wall of creepy tweets like "Go to www.mega.nz/file.zip" I scrolled down and suddenly BOOM I don't know what I saw but I knew it was bad. I immediately shut down my browser.</p>

<h1>Why did I click on the hashtag?</h1>

<p>Because. I trusted twitter to protect me.</p>

<p>I thought twitter was the safest website on Earth because it's controlled by "woke" college people. If you go on Tik-Tok and search "Thigh Gap" this is what you see. I thought twitter would do the same to protect me.</p>

<h1>I was wrong for trusting twitter.</h1>

<p>I was not brave enough to do deep research on this topic, but it looked to me like twitter had <b>unrestricted</b> child porn.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, I saw this Forbes article below, so I built the courage to click on the #s2r hashtag again, but only this time I noticed everything was 100% blocked!!! Elon Musk blocked the hashtag. Apparently, it's been a problem for many years. But Elon Musk fixed it in a few seconds!!! I can reasonably conclude that the previous owners of twitter are involved in some sort of pedophillic conspiracy.</p>

<p>Literally, on October 2022 the hashtag worked, and then on November 2022 it stopped working. Elon Musk owned twitter starting on October 26, 2022 <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1585341984679469056">1</a>. Here is proof. So I created my pzdh7h kiwifarms on October 7, 2022 because that's the month I was doing deep research on Craig Daniel Mansfield.</p>

<p>Check out this tweet. Not only did twitter refuse to fix the problem... Twitter did not EVEN have a report button for it!!</p>

<p>"this is false" with a lowercase T. Bitch, fuck you.</p>

<h1>Blocking Hate Speech</h1>

<p>When Elon Musk took over, the first thing I noticed is, when I typed @craigbob99 in the search bar, I got ZERO results, aka shadow-banned. Eventually, craigbob99 received account suspension.</p>

<p>Twitter search is not broken. Elon Musk fixed it.</p>

<h1>Blocking Anonymous Trolls</h1>

<p>I tried to make an anonymous twitter account. Elon Musk gave me a complex captcha!!! I passed the captcha, and it said "Failed". My only guess is Elon Musk blocked proton mail?!</p>

<p><img style="width:50%;" src="images/captcha.webp"></p>

<p><img style="width:50%;" src="images/failed.webp"></p>


<p>I just can't believe this sh*t. Twitter 1.0 did not have a captcha, meaning it didn't protect me from bots.</p>


<h1>Filter Bubble</h1>

<p>During Twitter 1.0, <b>every single time</b>, I clicked on ANYTHING from the trending page, I ALWAYS saw the SAME EXACT TWO people at the very TOP of the trending page. I don't know their names. It's an asian girl. And a man with a beard. And they would ALWAYS have less than 15 comments. Back then, I was like "WTF?!?! Does anyone even use twitter anymore?!? I must be a low life!! All I see is the same two people, and almost zero engagement!!!" All of a sudden, Elon Musk took over, I can't even find the asian girl and the man with a beard anymore. All I see is real people talking.</p>
