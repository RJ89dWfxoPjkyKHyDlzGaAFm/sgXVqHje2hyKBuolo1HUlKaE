<p>Ethan is sneaky like that. One time Ethan said "KeemStar, you are a very bad man for making false pedophile accusations against me. Don't you know, you can seriously ruin a man's career by doing that." Ever since that day, Ethan stopped using the word "pedo", and now Ethan says "sex offender", "human trafficker", or "predator" to replace the word "pedo."</p>
