<h1>Minecraft</h1>
<p>The same way Ethan believes grown men should not watch kpop, Ethan also believes grown men should not play minecraft. That explains why Ethan created this video portraying minecraft players as sexual deviants. Ethan believes all grown men who play minecraft or listen to kpop are pedophiles.<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21636&authkey=%21ANyFbmVSexf6oeA"></video><br>Source:<a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/0bdC1ig_014?t=438">1</a></p>

<h1>Sexual Harassment</h1>
<p>Due to Ethan's Minecraft video, Ethan was suspended from Youtube on August 11, 2021 for 7 days because Ethan Klein broke Youtube's "bullying and sexual harassment" policy because Ethan simulated having sex with a red puppet <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://poptopic.com.au/news/ethan-klein-simulates-sexual-violence-against-keemstar-in-new-video/">1</a>. The red puppet is based on a real adult man named Daniel Keem. Whenever Ethan hates you, he makes a doll of you and has sex with it on camera to make you feel worthless and weak. Imagine if Ethan owned a doll of a woman like Candace Owens, and Ethan raped it for a "funny video."<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21637&authkey=%21AJnmvm_hQE1X0gU"></video><br>Source:<a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/O57888ccAls">1</a><br>On July 4, 2020 Ethan saw this creepy Shane Dawson video. Four months later, suddenly Ethan Klein owns a Daniel Keem puppet. This creepy video literally inspired Ethan.</p>

<h1>Sexism</h1>
<p>Ethan Klein said "It's so sad how society does not take male victims of sexual abuse seriously." Here is Ethan Klein not giving a f*ck about the male victim of sexual abuse Spencer Elden. Spencer Elden filed a lawsuit claiming to be a male victim of child pornography. Ethan Klein described Spencer Elden's lawsuit as "obviously a cashgrab." Ethan Klein believes Spencer Elden is acting like a victim for financial gain.</p>

<h1>Zach Choi</h1>
<p>Ethan believes grown men should not do ASMR. When Ethan saw a man named Zack Choi doing ASMR, Ethan's first comment was "This guy is a pervert. Is he gay or straight?" Why does his sexual orientation matter? Because Ethan thinks all homosexuals are pedophiles.<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21638&authkey=%21AJ7Wml2U3jT_QBM"></video><br>Source:<a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/7OYtxY6d4MU?t=1694">1</a></p>

<p>When men do ASMR, Ethan accuses them of being perverts. But when women do ASMR, Ethan is sexually aroused by it.<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21639&authkey=%21AF1dIwNrA0pq6zI"></video><br>Ethan made it clear on twitter that he thinks it's okay for women to be lesbians; because he enjoys watching lesbian porn <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191008152651/https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1181587708658909184">1</a>, but he thinks its wrong for men to be homosexual. Also, Ethan believes grown men should not watch japanese anime.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\anime.webm"></audio>

<h1>Boogie2988</h1>
<p>This is how Ethan reacts when a 43 year old man (boogie2988) is dating a 19 year old woman (Lucy Foxx).</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\boogie.webm"></audio>

<h1>Skippy</h1>
<p>Here is Ethan congratulating a 40 year old man for watching "hot young teen porn."</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\skippy.webm"></audio>

<h1>James Charles</h1>
<p>Ethan is so blatantly homophobic that even TikTok deletes Ethan's videos due to homophobia <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ethankleinh3/video/6945220924778040582">2</a>, because Ethan constantly calls James Charles (gay) a pedo <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNBcgcwj3nX/?utm_source=ig_embed">1</a>,<a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNBXhxGDt2y/?utm_source=ig_embed">2</a>. So whenenver a straight man goes after young girls, Ethan congratulates him. But whenever a gay man goes after young boys, Ethan gets extremely angry. That explains why Ethan hates Michael Jackson (gay), but yet he loves R Kelly (straight).</p>

<h1>Bullying - Ian Slater</h1>
<p>Ethan bullies Ian because Ian is too effeminate. Human Resources got involved, and the bullying stopped. Here is Ethan calling Ian "stupid" and Ian felt so sad, he turned off the microphone.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\ian7.webm"></audio>Here is Ethan saying "Ian broke his foot, we tried to fire Ian, but Human Resources got involved."</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\ian8.webm"></audio></span><br>Here is proof that Ian had a real foot injury on episode #193.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\ian6.webm"></audio>I will explain the context. So basically, Ethan was reading a news article describing how Ellen Degeneres's toxic workplace caused an employee to attempt suicide, and Ethan nearly confessed outloud "That sounds similar to how we treat Ian." But Ethan stopped himself. Like this meme says "Ethan you should stop abusing Ian before it's too late." This meme says  Ethan's toxic workplace might cause Ian to commit suicide.<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21641&authkey=%21AC2TMwZmmjTKymY"></video><br>In one video, Ethan pranked Ian by telling him he is fired, and Ian almost cried on camera <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/-o0H2hp2lyY?t=315">1</a>. Ethan titled a second video "Ethan fires Ian <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdIpixFKcOI">2</a>." Ethan titled a third video "We Replaced Ian With A Robot <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB9KiJJlJL4">3</a>" The joke being that Ian is a useless employee whose job could easily be replaced with a robot. Ethan constantly plays a voice recording of Ian saying "I gotta pee so bad." The joke being Ian is a lazy employee who hides in the bathroom to avoid doing work. In a different video, Ethan tries to test Ian's masculinity by putting fire on Ian's beard, and immediately Ethan joked about burning and killing Ian <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu1kYYjrh74">4</a>.</p>

<h1>Homphobia - Ian Slater</h1>
<p>Imagine this. You apply for a job. But in order to get hired, you have to prove you're not a homosexual. That's literally what Ethan did to Ian Slater. That explains why Ethan forced Ian to be on a dating show. Here is Ian Slater saying he was happy being single, but then he felt forced into getting a girlfriend like it was a job requirement.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\ian3.webm"></audio>Episode #134, Ian is on a dating show. Episode #149, Ian got a girlfriend. Episode #150, Ian became a full time employee. It was a "prove you're not gay" hiring process.</p>

<p>Episode #178, Ethan and Hila are angry because they feel like Ian does "shticks." In other words, they think Ian is hiding something, like Ian is in the closet. When Hila said "We talk about everything," she is trying to say they've been honest with Ian, and so they expect the same honesty back.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\ian.webm"></audio>At this point, it seems like Ian is lying about having a girlfriend. Ian claims to have a girlfriend, but whenever Ethan wants to meet Ian's girlfriend, Ian comes up with elaborate excuses of why noone is allowed to meet her. Here is Ethan demanding to meet Ian's girlfriend. Ethan said "There's more information than that," because Ethan thinks Ian is hiding something, like Ian is in the closet.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\bully.webm"></audio>

<h1>Instagram</h1>
<p>For some unkown reason, Ethan deleted this photo.<br><img src="images\ethan.avif">Ethan described this pose as being "a primal mating display."<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21640&authkey=%21AFCaBP3TdsKvQyA"></video></p>
