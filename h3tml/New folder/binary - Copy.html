<p>In George Floyd's autopsy it says:</p>

<p class="three">"Manner of death is not a legal determination of culpability or intent, and should not be used to usurp the judicial process. Such decisions are outside the scope of the Medical Examinerâ€™s role or authority."</p>

<p>Imagine you killed someone, and you left a fake suicide note to confuse the police. The autopsy report will say "Death by Suicide." But it's left to the courts to decide if it was truly a suicide or a homicide.</p>

<p>I believe George Floyd died from an overdose. </p>
