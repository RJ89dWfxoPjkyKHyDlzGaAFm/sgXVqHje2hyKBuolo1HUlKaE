<h1>Homophobia</h1>
<p>The same way Ethan believes grown men should not watch kpop, Ethan also believes grown men should not play minecraft. Ethan believes all grown men who watch kpop or play minecraft are homosexual pedophiles. So that explains why Ethan created this video portraying minecraft players as sexual deviants.</p>

<h1>Sexual Harassment</h1>
<p>Due to the above video, on August 11, 2021 Ethan Klein was suspended from Youtube for 7 days because Ethan Klein broke Youtube's "bullying and sexual harassment" policy. The reason is because Ethan simulated having sex with a red puppet. The puppet is a custom made minature replica of a real man named Daniel Keem. Whenever Ethan hates you, he makes a doll of you and has sex with it on camera to make you feel worthless and weak. Remember when Ethan said "Nobody gives a f*ck about male victims of sexual abuse." Now imagine if Ethan owned a doll of a woman like Candance Owens and Ethan raped it for a "funny" video.<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21570&authkey=AFdT0w9qbf4Fxc0" type="video/mp4"></video><br>On July 4, 2020 Ethan saw this creepy Shane Dawson video. Four months later, suddenly Ethan Klein owns a Daniel Keem puppet. This creepy video literally inspired Ethan.</p>

<h1>Sexism</h1>
<p>Ethan Klein said "Nobody gives a f*ck about male victims of sexual abuse." Here is Ethan Klein not giving a f*ck about the male victim of sexual abuse Spencer Elden. Spencer Elden is the naked baby on the Nirvana album artwork. Spencer Elden filed a lawsuit claiming to be a male victim of child pornography. Ethan Klein described Spencer Elden's lawsuit as "obviously a cashgrab." Ethan Klein believes Spencer Elden is acting like a victim for financial gain.</p>

<h1>Homophobia - Ian Slater</h1>
<p>Imagine this. You apply for a job. But in order to get hired, you have to go on a dating show, get a girlfriend, and prove you're not a homosexual. That's literally what Ethan did to Ian Slater. For a long time, Ian's sexual orientation was unknown, and that explains why there are videos of Ethan bullying Ian, because Ethan hates gay men. Eventually, Ian got a girlfriend and the bullying stopped. Here is Ian Slater saying he was happy being single, but then he felt forced into getting a girlfriend like it was a job requirement.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\ian3.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>At some point, Ian told Ethan "I'm doing it for the views." So Ethan instructed Ian to have a real girlfriend, not a fake one.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\ian4.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></p>

<p>On Episode #134 Ethan forced Ian to be on a dating show. On episode #149 Ian got a girlfriend. On episode #150, Ian became a full time employee. It was the weirdest "prove you're not gay" hiring process.</p>

<p>Episode #178 is the episode everyone says is evidence of Ethan bullying Ian. Ethan and Hila are angry because they feel like Ian does "shticks." In other words, they think Ian is hiding something. When Hila says "We talk about everything," she is trying to say they've been honest with Ian, and so they expect the same honesty back from Ian.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\ian.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></p>

<p>At this point, it seems like Ian is lying about having a girlfriend. Ian claims to have a girlfriend, but whenever Ethan wants to meet Ian's girlfriend, Ian comes up with excuses of why noone can meet her. Here is Ethan demanding to meet Ian's girlfriend. Ethan said "There's more information than that," because Ethan thinks Ian is hiding something, like Ian is in the closet.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\bully.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></p>

<p>On episode #193 Ian had a foot injury. On episode #206 Ethan planned to use Ian's foot injury as an excuse to fire Ian. In other words, Ethan told Ian "Either you get a girlfriend or else you are fired from this job."</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\ian5.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>The context here is Ethan was reacting Ellen Degeneres's toxic workplace, and Ethan was about to confess "That sounds similar to what we do to Ian here."</p>

<h1>Accusations</h1>
<p>Ethan Klein accuses almost everyone of being a pedophile. Here is a list of innocent people Ethan called a pedophile: The Quartering, Keemstar, Alex Jones, Nelk Boys, therealjbecker2. It's crazy how many false pedophile accusations Ethan makes. He makes so many, he doesn't even remember doing them. Here is the Quartering asking Ethan "Why did you call me a pedophile?" Ethan said "No, I did not." They showed Ethan proof. And Ethan is all like "I accuse everyone of being a pedo, it's not a big deal."</p>

<h1>Skippy</h1>
<p>Ethan interviewed a forty year old virgin named Skippy who is a devout mormon, is saving himself for marriage. Ethan spent the next 20 minutes trying to convince Skippy to have sex before marriage.</p>








<<h1>Neil DeGrasse Tyson</h1>
<p>On Aug 9, 2019 Neil DeGrasse Tyson tweeted the above photo. Ethan was angry because Neil Tyson said viral pandemics are a bigger issue than white supremacy. Neil Tyson's rhetoric was correct all along because a few months later the COVID-19 pandemic began.</p>

<p>Ethan went on a 20 minute racist rant attacking Neil Tyson. Here is an excerpt.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\neil.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>

<p>Ethan believes all black people are addicted to illicit drugs. That explains why Ethan referred to Neil as "Smoke DeGrasse Tyson."</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\degrasse1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>

<p>Hila believes all black people are inherently violent. That explains why Hila joked about Neil Tyson being similar to OJ Simpson. "Hey twitter world, it's yours truly" is a reference to OJ Simpson's famous catch phrase. In a previous episode, Ethan called OJ Simpson "a known murderer."</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\truly.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>

<p>Ethan's employee Daniel Swerdlove believes all black people are intellectually retarded. That explains why Daniel said "This sh*t makes me miss Carl Sagan." "Sh*t" is a reference to Neil Tyson's brown skin color. By mentioning "Carl Sagan" Daniel believes black scientists are stupid compared to white scientists.</p>

<p>Ethan created a 9/11 parody of Neil's tweet. Ethan believes doing nothing about white supremacy is like doing nothing about 9/11. This is Ethan being islamophobic. Ethan believes America should go to war against white supremacy exactly like the bush administration went to war against muslims.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\islamophobic.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>

<h1>Sexism</h1>
<p>Ethan Klein said "Nobody gives a f*ck about male victims of sexual abuse." Here is Ethan Klein not giving a f*ck about the male victim of sexual abuse Spencer Elden. Spencer Elden is the naked baby on the Nirvana album artwork. Spencer Elden filed a lawsuit claiming to be a male victim of child pornography. Ethan Klein described Spencer Elden's lawsuit as "obviously a cashgrab." Ethan Klein believes Spencer Elden is acting like a victim for financial gain.</p>

<h1>Tokenism</h1>
<p>Tokenism is when a white person says "I'm not racist, my friend is black." Here is an audio clip of Ethan doing tokenism. Ethan said "I'm not xenophobic, my wife is a minority."</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21575&authkey=AEPhAhgFvCxOR9g" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>And here is Ethan accusing Steven Crowder and Tucker Carlson of doing tokenism.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21574&authkey=AFamQtAXPgu8-wM" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>

If Alex Jones is transphobic but watches trangender porn, then that means Ethan is a racist who married a minority. If anything it makes Ethan more racist, because Ethan has a slave owner fetish.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21577&authkey=AD0MrhWfJ6HAz0c" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>

<h1>Even More Racism</h1>
<p>"And The New Host Is..." Ethan Klein celebrates the death of Herman Cain, an innocent black man who died from coronavirus. Ethan is following an internet trend called "The Herman Cain Awards."</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21578&authkey=ABG8OMkfw2bRWY8" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>Ethan's co-host Hasan Piker explained the psychology behind why it is good to celebrate Herman Cain's death. He says "Conservatives are motivated by hatred." In other words, if you associate antivaxers with black people, it encourages racist people to get vaccinated.</p>

<h1>White Privilege</h1>
<p><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21532&authkey=AGeBG78ah4TyzWc" type="video/mp4"></video><br>Ethan allegedly received one million dollars for free, for no reason, from a random company called Starbreeze Studios. Ethan never denied it. Because there are news articles about it. Ethan only assured everyone that no crimes were committed. Almir Listo and Ethan are not close friends. There is only one explanation for this. I believe Almir Listo thought to himself "I'm white. Ethan Klein is white. I believe in socialism. Ethan Klein believes in socialism. I am going to donate $1 million to Ethan Klein simply because I love white people who believe in socialism just like me." Literally, Ethan received $1 million for having white skin.</p>

<h1>Prisoners</h1>
<p>Ethan rudely interrupts his employees to tell everyone that society needs to stop being rude to prisoners.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\prisons.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>

<h1>Biased News</h1>
<p>Ethan gets angry whenever the news reports unbiased news. Ethan wants the New York Times to hide Alec Baldwin's criminal history.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\baldwin.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>

<h1>Apology</h1>
<p>In Ethan's video titled "My Experience With The Police," Ethan apologized for all the racist things he has done. He told his famous quote "Sometimes a hypocrite is just a man in the process of changing, and it is never too late to change for the better." Eventually, Ethan went on to say it is too late for antivaxers to change. Racist against black people? Ethan says "It's never too late to change." Racist against jews? Ethan says "Death to all of them."</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\antivax.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>Ethan wants to kill all antivaxers because the vast majority of antivaxers believe in antisemitic conspiracy theories. Ethan spent over 5 years on youtube saying racist things, all of a sudden george floyd died, and suddenly Ethan isn't racist anymore. Do you honestly believe Ethan stopped being racist that fast? The truth is Ethan never stopped being racist. He only got better at hiding it.</p>

<h1>Nanny</h1>
<p>We know Ethan grew up with a maid in the household. But also, here is Ethan saying "Everyone has nannies. All my (white) employees have nannies. Only rich people don't have nannies." OMG Ethan is so poor, that he is forced to own a nanny!</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\nanny.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>The above audio is edited, I clipped together the important quotes. Ethan believes if you own a nanny, it means you are an average working class american. He believes only rich people have the luxury of time to spend with their children. So that is why he believes only poor people own nannies.</p>

<h1>White Privilege</h1>
<p><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21532&authkey=AGeBG78ah4TyzWc" type="video/mp4"></video><br>Ethan received a large sum of money; allegedly $1 million dollars, for free, for no reason, from a random company called Starbreeze Studios.

<h1>Vice President</h1>
<p>Here is Ethan texting the Vice President of Youtube.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\vp.mp3" type="video/mp4"></audio>This is a huge deal because Markiplier, Penguinz0, Philip DeFranco, and CoryxKenshin all of them struggle to receive replies from youtube. Markiplier tweeted #AnswerUsYoutube to raise awareness. Markiplier is way more famous than Ethan Klein. But yet here is Markiplier saying "Spam this message to Youtube, get them to pay attention to me. I can't get them to answer my god damn emails. I'm mad."<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21586&authkey=AFB5VwbaTCoDJc0" type="video/mp4"></video><br></p>

<p>CoryxKenshin is way more famous than Ethan.

<p>When famous youtubers email youtube for technical support, despite their fame, they still receive only computer generated replies. But not Ethan. Due to Ethan's white privilege, Ethan gets replies directly from the Vice President.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\summit.mp3" type="video/mp4"></audio>Here is Jason Nash explaining what it feels like to have white privilege. It's like a little club.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\privilege.mp3" type="video/mp4"></audio>

<p>Here is Ethan saying "I have a close friend who works at Youtube Headquarters," because Ethan was reacting to the Nasim Aghdam mass shooting which occured at Youtube Headquarters.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\nasim.mp3" type="video/mp4"></audio>Here is Ethan saying "I'm texting my friend who works at Tik-Tok."</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\tiktok.mp3" type="video/mp4"></audio>People started noticing how Ethan is friends with all these CEOs, tech executives, laywers, and vice presidents. Ethan Klein says it's anti-semitic.</p>

<h1>Ethan's Lawyers</h1>
<p>Ethan's lawyers are so dependable that Ethan constantly tells random people "I dare you to sue me."</p>
