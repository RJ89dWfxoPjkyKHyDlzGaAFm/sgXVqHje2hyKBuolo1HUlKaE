<h1>Why I stopped listening to the H3 Podcast </h1>
<p>Ethan says...</p>
<p>All grown men who play minecraft are pedophiles <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="minecraft.html">1</a>.</p>

<p>All grown men who do ASMR are pedophiles <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="choi.html">1</a>.</p>

<p>Ethan said "I just know every man underneath those disney costumes are pedophiles <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="disney.html">1</a>."</p>

<p>Ethan tweeted "When you become rich and famous, you automatically turn into a pedophile <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1404152731011407873">1</a>."</p>

<h1>7.5 minutes of Ethan</h1>
<video controls preload="none"><source src="../videos/ethan.webm"></video>

<p>It's disgusting how Ethan describes pedophiles as "he fucks kids bro" similar to how frat boys describe their bestfriends "he fucks bitches bro."</p>

<p>*Walks into a children's bathroom.* Ethan: "Mmm I feel like a pedophile"</p>
<p>Steve Harvey: "Men cheat for the same reason women cheat." Ethan: "Mmm that sounds like pedophilia."</p>
<p>AB Ayad: What do you think about the Jedi from Star Wars? Ethan: "Mmm I heard they f*ck kids."</p>

<h1>But of all the things Ethan has said on his podcast, this one is by far the worst.</h1>
<p>I feel so sick to my stomach. I can't believe this is allowed on YouTube of all places. Ethan said "I bet your mommy molested you, that's why you turned into a little gay sissy faggot, that's why you need therapy, that's why you suffer from a mental disorder, because you are a gay pedophile faggot."</p>

<p>Ethan tweeted "Fuck you faggot, kill yourself <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/483953195886993408">1</a>"</p>

<h1>Patrice Wilson</h1>
<p>Ethan ruined Patrice Wilson's career.</p>
<p><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\patrice.webm"></audio></p>
<p>"I lost my house, cars, career, belongings, everything. I wanted to kill myself."</p>

<p>Basically, Ethan said "Patrice Wilson is n*gger f*aggot pedophile who loves to rape white women. And in the ends, Ethan pretends to call the police on Patrice Wilson, because Ethan thinks it's hilarious when the police kill innocent black men.</p>

<p>The Tulsa Massacre happened because one white man spread a rumor that supposedly there was an unhinged black man on the loose eating and raping blonde girls.</p>

<p>In china, the Ürümqi Riots happened because one chinese man started a rumor that supposedly there was an unhinged muslim man on the loose eating and raping chinese women.</p>

<p>The movie King Kong, is about a black man who destroys cities and only wants to rape white women.</p> 

<h1>Teddy Fresh is a toxic workplace</h1>
<p><a aria-hidden="true" href="glassdoor.html">https://JovannyR.com/h3tml/glassdoor</a></p>
<p>According to LinkedIn.com, Teddy Fresh's turnover rate is 10.8 months. In other words, every 10.8 months, Ethan & Hila fire all their employees and replace them with new ones. But McDonald's, Walmart, Starbucks, and Target all have a turnover rate of ~3.8 years.</p>

<p>March 4, 2022 "Please, we are <b>desperate</b> for Teddy Fresh employees, send us your resume to Jobs@TeddyFresh.com." That's when the glassdoor reviews started.</p>
<p><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/ytxfQ8kxNAE?t=680">https://youtu.be/ytxfQ8kxNAE?t=680</a></p>

<p>Feb 26, 2020 "Hila cracked the whip on a <b>NEW</b> employee, and it scared the shit out of me. Hila rules with an iron fist."</p>

<p>My face when Ethan does something goofy or funny.</p>

<p>My face when I remember all of Ethan's financial crimes.</p>

<h1>Ethan's Financial Crimes</h1>
<p><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/DdpkW14cShk?t=597">https://youtu.be/DdpkW14cShk?t=597</a></p>
<p>Why would a random person, Almir Listo, donate $1 million to Ethan? It is obvious, Almir Listo was thinking "I'm white. Ethan is white. I believe in socialism. Ethan believes in socialism. I am going to donate $1 million to Ethan because I love white people who believe in socialism just like me." Ethan got $1 million for being born white.</p>

<p>Ethan donated $50,000, took a screenshot of it, posted the screenshot on twitter, several hours later, the $50,000 dissapeared from GoFundMe.com.</p>

<p><a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Rae2Bae/status/1530784036083404801">https://twitter.com/Rae2Bae/status/1530784036083404801</a></p>

<p>On Ethan's screenshot, it says "Teddy Fresh donated on May 28, 2022." Today, GoFundMe says "Teddy Fresh donated on May 31, 2022 14:10 GMT <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://gateway.gofundme.com/web-gateway/v1/feed/mtdrdc-texas-elementary-school-shooting-victims-fund/donations?limit=10&offset=0&sort=highest">1</a>,<a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/mtdrdc-texas-elementary-school-shooting-victims-fund">2</a>"</p>
