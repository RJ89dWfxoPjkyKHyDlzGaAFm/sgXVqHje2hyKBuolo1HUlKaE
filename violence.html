 <h1>The Data Says</h1>
 <p>White-on-white violence is 38% more prevalent than black-on-black violence. Black-on-white violence is 3,700% more prevalent than white-on-black violence.</p>
 <h1>There is just one problem</h1>
 <p>The data was acquired by interviewing 151,055 households, which was 242,928 unique persons in the United States. Table 9 estimated 23.2 violent victimizations per 1,000 persons. So it seems like they interviewed 10,471 victims. The data depended on the victim's perception of what race were the perpetrators. In essence, what you have here is a blame game. But this does not disqualify the data's validity. </p>
