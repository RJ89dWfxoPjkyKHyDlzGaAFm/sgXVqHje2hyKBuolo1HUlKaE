<p>The data was acquired by interviewing 242,928 random unique persons in the Unites States. Then, they do crazy math problems to apply it to the U.S population. The data depended on the victim's perception of what a violent incident is, and the victim's perception of what race the perpetrator was. The data also depended on the honesty of participants. Because of that limitation, I am presenting the same exact numbers, but presented as victim-said-perpetrator. If you trust the honesty and perception of victims, the above data demonstrates who is committing crime. If you do not trust the honesty and perception of victims, the below data demonstrates who is blamed for crime.</p>
 
 <p>The FBI also counts real crimes reported to law enforcement, but many Black Lives Matter people do not trust crime statistics because they believe blacks are persecuted by police. Blacks Lives Matter people believe if police harrassed whites too, the crime statistics would be equal for whites and blacks. Other Black Lives Matter do not contest the crime statistics. They believe Blacks commit crime simply because they are oppressed from slavery/racism, and blacks are denied healthcare, housing, employement, and education.</p>
