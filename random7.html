<p>In order to understand this page you have to understand three logical fallacies called "Natural Fallacy," "Smartness Fallacy," and "Suffering Fallacy."</p>

<h1>Natural Fallacy</h1>
<p>"Naturalness" does not equal "good." For example, the sun is natural, but yet the sun causes skin cancer. Asbestos is natural, it causes cancer. Aluminum is the third most naturally occuring element on Earth, it causes brain damage. Gasoline is natural, it comes from the ground, it gives you cancer. The ocean is natural, if you drink it, you die. Carbon Dioxide is natural, it causes Global Warming. Also, "artificial" does not automatically equal "bad."</p>

<h1>Smartness Fallacy</h1>
<p>"Smart and talented" does not make you a "nice" person. For example, Woody Allen has a talent of making movies, but he's a pedophile. Mahatma Gandhi isn't "smart" but he is one of the nicest persons of history. In fact, smart people are the most dangerous of all, because they can commit crimes, they know how to hide evidence, and manipulate people. That's why smart people rarely end up in prison. Often the person who hurt you the most ends up being your own bestfriend, family member, or intimate partner, someone you loved and trusted, you shared great memories with them, they made you smile and laugh, it makes you hate them more because you're smiling at them, but you know that person deep down is truly evil.</p>

<h1>Suffering Fallacy</h1>
<p>If someone else is suffering more than you, it does not invalidate your own suffering. For example, when Meghan Markle confessed to the public how she is experiencing suicidal thoughts, many responded by telling Meghan "You have nothing to be suicidal about. You're rich, you own a mansion, you have a perfect life. There are starving children in africa." Another example, just because blacks have it worse than whites, it does not invalidate the fact whites do suffer. Or just because africans suffer more than african-americans, it does not invalidate the fact african-americans are suffering. </p>

<h1>Neo-Luddism</h1>
<p>Evolutionary Psychology is hate speech, ever since the Unabomber wrote in his manifesto "Nature is beautiful." The Unabomber was a Neo-luddite. Neo-luddites believe the futher humanity strays from nature, the worse off we are spiritually, emotionally, and phsyically. We must live in symbiosis with nature, like Native Americans, picking berries, and hunting animals. Stop wearing deodorant, stop driving cars, stop showering, stop social media, stop processed foods, stop vaccines, stop 5G towers. Many neo-luddites say "Rape is natural. Natural is always good. Therefore, rape is good." So that's why evolutionary psychology is hate speech. Neo-luddism and the Natural Fallacy justifies everything from rape, killing, to racism. For example, this video shows Chimpanzees form gangs to kill foreigners. Neo-luddites would say "Killing immigrants is natural. Natural is good."<br><a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQn1-mLkIHw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQn1-mLkIHw</a></p>
