<h1>DRAFT</h1>
  
<p>I was a young adult, I was walking outside of a Lowe's hardware store. A white woman was parked inside of her Toyota SUV on Lowe's parking lot. The woman's car was flawless and brand new. The woman stepped out of her car and said "Can you answer my question? What kind of person steals from other people?" I thought she was accusing me of stealing items from her car. I wanted to assure her I did not steal from her. The woman then said "Someone burglarized my mother's home while we were on vacation. They stole everything from us including our furniture. My mother's house is empty. Please help me. I'll pay any amount of money to have those sentimental valuables returned to us. Who did this to us? Do you know who it was?" At this point I thought to myself "This woman picked me because of my skin color, she thinks since I'm hispanic that I might be friends with the gangmembers who burglarized that house." I replied "Organized criminals did this to you." The woman's deameanor changed as she replied "Yes! Criminals! But WHO did this to us? Who?! My brother says it's blacks, my mother says it's mexicans. Do you want to know what I think? I think it's Jewish people! Jewish people are causing all the world's problems! The bible says..."</p>
  
<p>That person was the first anti-semitic person I encountered in real life. Before that, anti-semitism was just a thing I read in history books.</p>
  
<p>Some years later, I became depressed and suicidal. I felt like the world isn't fair. I was remembering about how when I was a kid I watched History Channel about Nazis, secret technology, and aliens. I began by thinking to myself "Maybe Nazis are the good guys who lost the war. What if the bad guys won." I gave up on life. So that was how I went on google and typed "Jewish Conspiracy."</p>
  
<p>From there I found a website called "Encyclopedia Dramatica." The Jewish conspiracy article didn't interest me. It seemed like a stupid conspiracy. But then I clicked on other articles from there. I found one article called Basement Dweller, Incel, YOU, /b/, Aspies, N word, K word. I spent the entire day doing nothing except reading as many articles as I could find. I didn't like what I was reading, but I stayed because I felt like I was a scholar traversing a new world, trying to understand a foreign culture. I didn't like how they used the N word and K word a lot. When I got to an article called Adolf Hitler, it said "Click here if you are offended." I clicked on it, and all of a sudden my screen was covered with photos of a gaping butt hole, there was a woman drinking vomit and eating poop. I didn't look at the other photos. I didn't like this type of comedy.</p>
