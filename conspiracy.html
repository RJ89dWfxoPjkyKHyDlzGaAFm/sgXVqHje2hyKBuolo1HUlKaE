<p>I was a young adult, I was walking outside of a Lowe's hardware store. A white woman was parked inside of her Toyota SUV on Lowe's parking lot. The woman's car was flawless and brand new. The woman stepped out of her car and said "Can you answer my question? What kind of person steals from other people?" I thought she was accusing me of stealing items from her car. I wanted to assure her I did not steal from her. The woman then said "Someone burglarized my mother's home while we were on vacation. They stole everything from us including our furniture. My mother's house is empty. Please help me. I'll pay any amount of money to have those sentimental valuables returned to us. Who did this to us? Do you know who it was?" At this point I thought to myself "This woman picked me because of my skin color, she thinks since I'm hispanic that I might be friends with the gangmembers who burglarized that house." I replied "Organized criminals did this to you." The woman's deameanor changed as she replied "Yes! But WHO did this to us? Who?! My brother says it's blacks, my mother says it's mexicans. Do you want to know what I think? I think it's Jewish people! Jewish people are causing all the world's problems! The bible says..."</p>
