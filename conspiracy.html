<p>During High School, I was told "Racism exists because of evolution. A long time ago, humans lived in small groups called tribes. Whenever a tribe saw foreigners, it always meant the foreigners were about to either deceive or attack for resources. Naturally our brains evolved with an instinctual suspicion of outsiders."</p>
  
<p>I was a young adult, I was walking outside of a Lowe's hardware store. There was a white woman standing next to her expensive brand new car. The woman was alone. The white woman said "Can you answer my question? What kind of person steals from other people?" I thought she was accusing me of stealing items from her car. I wanted to assure her I did not steal from her. The woman then said "Someone burglarized my mother's home while she was on vacation. They stole everything from us including our furniture. My mother's house is empty. Please help me. I'll pay any amount of money to have those sentimental valuables returned to us. Who did this to us? Do you know who it was?" At this point I thought to myself "This woman picked me because of my skin color, she thinks since I'm hispanic that I might be friends with the gangmembers who burglarized that house." I replied "Organized criminals did this to you." The woman's deameanor changed as she replied "Yes! But WHO did this to us? Who?! My brother says it's blacks, my mother says it's mexicans. Do you want to know what I think? I think it's Jewish people! Because in the bible it says..."</p>
  
<p>I left when she said the word bible. I had to leave but I wish I had stayed and talked to that woman. I was worried. She seemed like she was having a mental break-down, like she was about to do a mass shooting or something. When I left, her face was slightly looking up towards the sky as if she was seeing bible verses in the sky. She didn't seem like the usual drug addicted schitzophrenic women I have seen. The woman's skin was flawless, her clothes were clean. I know the brand new car was hers since I saw her opening and closing the doors as if she was frantically searching for someone's business card.</p>
