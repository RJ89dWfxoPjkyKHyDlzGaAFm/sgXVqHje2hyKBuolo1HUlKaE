<h1>DRAFT</h1>
<p>During elementary school, when I first learned about Nazis my teacher said "Aryan means blonde hair and blue eyes." As a kid I was thinking to myself "They fought a war only because of a skin color?! That is the stupidest reason to start a holocaust! This can't be real. No way. This is a joke."</p>
  
  <p>When I was a young adult, I started to be suspicious of my teachers. I said to myself "There is no way they fought a war only because of a skin color. This is not realistic. War is when eople are really passionate about a certain opinion that they are willing to kill and die for it. Skin color, is not a reason to kill and die."
