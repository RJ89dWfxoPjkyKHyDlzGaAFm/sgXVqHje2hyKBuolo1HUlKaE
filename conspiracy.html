<p>During elementary school, when I first learned about Nazis my teacher said "Nazis didn't like people like you and me. We would all be in those concentration camps simply because of our skin color." As a kid I was thinking to myself "They fought a war only because of a skin color?! That is the stupidest reason to start a holocaust! This can't be real. No way. This is a joke."
  
During middle school, I said to myself "There is no way they fought a war only because of a skin color. This is fake history. They are hiding something from me. This is not realistic. War is when they are really passionate about a certain opinion which they are willing to kill and die for. Skin color, is not a good enough reason. War is weird. Like why would anyone go to war when there is television and video games."   
  
During High School, I was told "Racism exists because of evolution. A long time ago, humans lived in small groups called tribes. Whenever a tribe saw foreigners, it always meant the foreigners were about to either deceive or attack for resources. Naturally our brains evolved with an instinctual suspicion of outsiders."</p>
