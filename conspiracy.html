<p>During High School, I was told "Racism exists because of evolution. A long time ago, humans lived in small groups called tribes. Whenever a tribe saw foreigners, it always meant the foreigners were about to either deceive or attack for resources. Naturally our brains evolved with an instinctual suspicion of outsiders."</p>
