<p>During High School, I was told "Racism exists because of evolution. A long time ago, humans lived in small groups called tribes. Whenever a tribe saw foreigners, it always meant the foreigners were about to either deceive or attack for resources. Naturally our brains evolved with an instinctual suspicion of outsiders."</p>
  
<p>I was a young adult, I was walking outside of a Lowe's hardware store. There was a white woman standing next to her expensive brand new car. The white woman said "Can you answer my question? What kind of person steals from other people?" I thought she was accusing me of stealing items from her car. I wanted to assure her I did not steal from her. The woman then said "Hello. Can you please help me. Someone burglarized my mother's home while she was on vacation. They stole everything from us including our furniture. My mother's house is empty. Who did this to us? Do you know who it was?" I replied "Organized criminals." The woman's demanor changed as she said "Yes! And who are those criminals?"</p>
