<h1>Mr. Hornstra</h1>
<p>During middle school I had a Physical Education teacher named Mr. Hornstra. Mr. Hornstra showed us a video of when him with his friends traveled across the country on bicylces. He said "We went ocean to ocean on our bikes. We started on California with our back tire touching the Pacific Ocean. The finish-line was when the front of our bike tire touched the Atlantic ocean." He used to have long blonde hair. Now he is bald. Mr. Hornstra explained "We bicyled in one straight column, since it was advantageous. You see, the person in front absorbed the impact of the wind, so the rest of us would conserve glycogen. We adjusted our seats based on the angle of our knee bend."</p>

<p>I had very bad eyesight. One day I wore glasses to middle school for my first time. Mr. Hornstra said to me "I remember the first time I wore my prescription glasses. It appeared as though someone had painted the walls with fresh paint. When I looked at a tree, with all its textures I realized how beautiful life is." Mr. Hornstra always said gay things.</p>

<p>One day Mr. Hornstra said "Do you know the game Jenga? Trustworthiness is similar to a tower of Jenga. Each wooden block represents a unit of trustworthiness. Do you understand how easily Jenga towers collapse? When someone breaks your trust, that means they knocked over your Jenga tower. Each friendship starts at zero wooden blocks. Each act of kindness, results in a new wooden block. But all it takes is one mistake to destroy a wooden tower. It takes many years to build your tower of trust, but only seconds to destroy it. A strong foundation of trust is crucial. A Jenga founded upon lies or deception is destined to collapse."</p>
 
<p>One student interrupted "But Mr. Hornstra, what if the tower was made of Lego's?" Mr. Horntra scoffed "Then it would be painful to step on." Another student interrupted "But what about if you dipped everything in superglue?" Mr. Hornstra said "Now that is just being silly." The only black student in the classroom stood up, announcing to everyone "I think my dad was born with negative wooden blocks, because the cops put him in prison." Then, Mr. Hornstra showed us a video of a man who lived a happy life despite having no arms and no legs.</p>
