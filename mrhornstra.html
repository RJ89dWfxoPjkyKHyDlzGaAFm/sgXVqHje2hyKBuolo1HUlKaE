<h1>Mr. Hornstra</h1>
<p>During middle school I had a Physical Education teacher named Mr. Hornstra. Mr. Hornstra showed us a video of when him with his friends traveled across the country on bicylces. He said "We went ocean to ocean on our bikes. We started on California with our back tire touching the Pacific Ocean. We completed when the front of our bike touched the Atlantic ocean." He used to have long blonde hair. Now he is bald. Mr. Hornstra explained "We bicyled in one straight column, because it was advantageous. You see, the person in front would absorb the impact of the wind, so the rest of us would conserve glycogen. We adjusted our seats based on the angle of our knees."</p>

<p>I had very bad eyesight. One day I wore glasses to middle school for the first time. Mr. Hornstra said to me "I remember the first time I wore prescription glasses. I felt as though someone painted the walls with fresh paint. When I looked at a tree, with all its textures I realized how beautiful life is." Mr. Hornstra always said gay things.</p>

<p>One day Mr. Hornstra said "Do you know the game Jenga? Trustworthiness is smilar to a tower of wooden blocks. Do you know how easy it is to topple over a Jenga tower? It is equally easy to topple over someone's trust. Trust is a commodity that we must earn. Upon initially meeting someone, then you begin with zero wooden blocks together. As you earn trust, then you must add a block. When you acquire a frienship, then you must add another block or two. But all it takes is one mistake and everything that you have built together has toppled. It is important to build a strong foundation of trust. A foundation that was founded upon lies or deception is one that is destined to collapse."</p>
 
<p>One student interrupted "But Mr. Hornstra, what if the tower was made of Lego's?" Mr. Horntra scoffed "Then it would be painful to step on." Another student interrupted "But what about if you dipped everything in superglue?" Mr. Hornstra said "Now that is just being silly." The only black student in the classroom stood up, announcing everyone "I think my dad was born with negative wooden blocks, because the cops put him in prison." Then, Mr. Hornstra showed us a video of a man who lived a happy life despite having no arms and no legs.</p>
