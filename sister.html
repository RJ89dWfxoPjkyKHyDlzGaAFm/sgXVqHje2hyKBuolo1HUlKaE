<h1>I Hate My Sister</h1>
 
 <p>My name is Jovanny Rodriguez. I am Mexican-American Chicano heritage. The thesis of my story is NOT that I hate my sister. My thesis is that every Mexican rolemodel in my life has either dissapointed or disheartened me.</p>
 
<p>The Mexican comedian named Felipe Esparza had a similar experience as me. His Mexican father abandoned him. His Mexican friends gave him drugs and "jumped" him into a Mexican gang. Mexican gangmembers frequently attempted to murder Felipe. Felipe reached rockbottom when he purchased a lethal firearm while addicted to crack cocaine, PCP, and alcohol; and Felipe had to choose if he would become a killer OR not.</p>
 
<p>A white man named Father <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Boyle">Greg Boyle</a> helped Felipe Esparza quit drugs. A white Irish man at a bar asked Felipe "Felipe, what are your 5 long-term goals?" Felipe said "I never had a father figure. That one simple question changed my life. I realized I didn't want to be a killer. I wanted to be a comedian." [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGooLR6kckY">1</a>]</p><hr>
 
 <p>During 2015, my sister's Salvadorian Gangster exboyfriend was released from prison. My sister moved out of our parent's property to a more secure location. During 2018, my sister's friend was murdered by an exboyfriend. The exboyfriend was released from prison. He logged onto Facebook and saw that his exgirlfriend purchased a new house, a new car, she was pregnant and living with a new boyfriend. The exconvict purchased a shotgun and killed 3 people. He killed the exgirlfriend, the exgirlfriend's latest boyfriend, and the exconvict also killed his own bestfriend since he was a witness. My sister and her friends are all the same. They all have the same stupid problems.</p><hr>
 
  
<p>When I was 6-11 years old, my sister performed a horrible "prank" on me. It was nighttime. I was having a hot shower in my bathroom. My bathroom doorknob was <a href="https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/63ff138e-0395-4c15-b6a5-0d3ff4788e8f/svn/defiant-privacy-door-knobs-t8610b-64_1000.jpg">this</a>. My sister unlocked my bathroom door with a U.S coin, and she waited patiently for me. I finished my shower. I turned off my hot showerhead water. The loud hissing sound of my showerhead stopped. I was standing there naked in my bathtub. BUT THEN, suddenly my sister kicked my bathroom door open. My sister pulled my shower curtains. The shower rod and curtains collapsed. My sister poured a <a href="https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/dcb61c19-81e8-41a2-85fa-3759b5b11433/svn/paint-buckets-lids-rg5700-64_1000.jpg">bucket</a> of room temperature water over my head and naked body. My sister ran away. She flipped my bathroom light switch off. My only lightsource dissapeared. I was standing there naked in the cold and darkness. I was shivering, yelling, and crying. I could not see anything. I didn't know what was happening. I could only hear my sister in the corridor laughing hysterically. My sister dumped room temperature water on me, but compared to my hot shower, it felt like ice cubes.</p><hr>
 
<p>Tomorrow I am going to share the second horrible "prank" my sister performed on me...</p><hr>
 
<p>For many years, my sister was addicted to crystal methamphetamine. My sister's crystal methamphetamine addiction began when she was atleast 11 years old. My sister went to rehab and successfully quit methamphetamine by her 18th birthday.</p><hr>
 
<p>When I was 11 years old, my sister arrived home with broken glass shards on her back. Her back was bleeding. No one knows why.</p><hr>
 
 <p>At 27 years old, my sister accidentally drove her car into a fire hydrant. The fire hydrant exploded. There was a mountain of water. When asked what happened, my sister said "I drank a little bit of alcohol last night, but I wasn't hungover. I was simply tired and stressed from work. I am done drinking. Drinking is... I am over it. I drank too much this year. It's not fun anymore."</p>
 
 <p>To this day my sister still drinks alcohol.</p><hr>
 
 <p>When I was 11 years old, my sister witnessed a murder. Two cops appeared at my house to ask my sister a few questions regarding the murder. My sister was high on meth. My sister removed her garments and ran away. My sister was running naked on the streets with no clothes on. One cop said "You're not in trouble. Please cover yourself with this bathtowel," but my sister yelled "SEXUAL ABUSE! FUCK PIGS! COPS ARE RAPISTS!"</p><hr>
 
 <p>My uncle accidentally crashed his car into a sidewalk. His car flipped over and he almost died. He claims he was neither drunk nor high. Later during the same year, my uncle was driving while I was in the passenger seat. A black vehicle crashed into us. The African-American male exited his vehicle and said "I am terribly sorry. I ran the red light." A white female yelled "Help! My baby!" The white woman ran in circles around the black vehicle, opening and closing differt doors. The African-American male said "The white woman is with me. She is my passenger. She has schitzophrenia. We don't have a baby, there is no baby in my car. But sometimes she calls me her babe."</p>
  
<p>We got picked up by a Tow Truck. My uncle recognized the Tow Driver's passenger. Immediately, the African-American Tow Driver said "You each are getting $3,000. All you have to do is call THIS number. Tell him I sent you. Just tell them your back hurts." I replied "Our accident wasn't that bad. I feel just fine. That would be lying." All three men stared angrily at me. The African-American took a deep breath and said "There is a thing called "whiplash." You feel fine today, but in a few weeks or months you'll start to feel the effects." The black Tow Driver took us to an Auto Body Shop. The Auto Body Shop personnel were all Mexicans, they said "Don't worry about anything! Your insurance will cover all the costs! All you have to do is sign this paperwork. We called an Uber for you. Your Uber will arrive in 20 minutes. Your Uber is free! Don't worry about anything!"</p>
 
 <p>A few days later, my uncle took me to a chiropractor. We filled out a questionnaire there. An African attorney man approached us and said "Explain what happened. Give me your I.D. and social security." The black man was wearing a tuxedo, a fedora hat, he carried a briefcase. An African chiropractor said "Tell me where it hurts." He made us both sit on a vibrating massage chair for 15 minutes. Then the black chiropractor said "Come back again soon."<p>
 
 <p>I realized it was a total scam! Everyone was in on it! The black attorney, the black chiropractor, the black Tow Truck Drivers, and the Mexican Auto Body Repair Shop! They were all in on this car insurance scam! I read carefully through all the paperwork! It said we were going to get $30,000. The chiropractor takes $10,000. The attorney takes $10,000. That means me and my uncle would take the leftoever $10,000. The Auto Body Repair Shop was scamming insurance companies for a thing called a "Storage Fee." The Tow Driver was earning a commission. </p>
 
 <p>I attempted to explain to my whole family how my uncle was forcing me to participate in an insurance fraud. I told my uncle "You gave him your I.D. and social security, how do you know if he isn't stealing your identity and getting loans?" My uncle replied "It's okay. Just relax. Smoke some weed. Those people know what they are doing. They've done this many times."</p>
 
 <p>I explained to my Dad that Insurance fraud is illegal. I told him "Dad, do you remember you got in a minor car accident. Then your monthly insurance cost increased." My Dad said "Well, that is how life works. If you play your cards right." That was when I realized my Dad was a total con artist. He cheated on my mom. He has a brand new car and lives in a mansion. But yet he never paid Child Support. My Dad lived lavishly. Then he filed for bankruptcy. My Dad also used to force dogs to fight for money.</p> 
 
 <p>When I was 8 years old, I was at the movie theatre with my dad and my sister. The movie finished. We were walking up many staircases at a tall concrete parking lot building. When we got to our car, my Dad and my sister argued about something. At 8 years old, I didn't know what sexual intercourse was. I knew it was forbidden. I knew that my Dad and my sister were arguing about sex because of the tone of their voices. My sister said "You are a creep. You were intentionally staring up at a woman's skirt. She was walking in front of us, walking upstairs too." My Dad replied "No. I wasn't." My sister replied "What was our conversation about while we were walking upstairs?" My Dad replied "You were saying something about the movie." My sister replied "What was I saying ABOUT the movie?" My Dad replied "I don't know. Your brother was distracting me."
 
 <p>When I was 8 years old, my Dad took me to his friend's house. Their tone of voice changed, so I knew they were talking about sex. My Dad started talking in Spanish language. I understood what my Dad was saying. My Dad said "I purchased a High Definition television. It looks amazing. Pornography looks amazing. I saw a woman spreading her legs for the camera. I saw beads of perspiration."
 
 <p>When I was 9 years old, my Dad took me to a family birthday party. There was an elderly woman with a giant mole on her face. There was an elderly man with one silver eye that never moved. It was as if he snapped one day, and went crazy. I believe the medical condition is called Strabismus. Everyone was drinking alcohol. The elderly man with Strabismus said "Come here." The elderly man pulled my arm, and said "How old are you?" I replied "I am 9 years old." The eldery man said "How many girlfriends do you have?" I replied "Zero." The elderly man said "When I was 9, I had atleast 5-6 girlfriends. What is the matter with your son? Is he homosexual? Young man, the next time I see you, I want to hear that you have 5-6 girlfriends." </p>
 
 <p>My mom and my biological dad divorced before I was born. My sister was alive during their divorce. The court said my Dad was supposed to pay for child support, and two times a month my Dad was allowed to visit his children. My Mom NEVER talked about my Dad. Everyone was forbidden from talking about my Dad. The only time my Mom would talk about my Dad was every few months my mom would get so drunk she would say the craziest things. My drunk Mom said "I hope I get cancer. The day a doctor tells me that I have cancer, I am going to purchase a gun and kill ONE person. That is the ONLY way I could die peacefully." My mom would never say who it was, but everyone knew she was talking about killing my Dad. I asked my drunk mom "What happened between you and my Dad?" My drunk mom said "Your Dad was lazy. He never worked. He never contributed rent. He never paid child support. He cheated on me. He used to get drunk and punch me with his fists. All he did was watch television. What else do you need to know? That is everything that you need to know. You live underneath my roof. I pay all the bills. If you like your Dad so much, why don't you go live with him? Certainly your Dad can spare you a bedroom in that giant mansion he has." </p>
