<h1>I Hate My Sister</h1>
 
 <p>My name is Jovanny Rodriguez. I am Mexican-American Chicano heritage. The thesis of my story is NOT that I hate my sister. My thesis is that every Mexican rolemodel in my life has either dissapointed or disheartened me.</p>
 
<p>The Mexican comedian named Felipe Esparza had a similar experience as me. His Mexican father abandoned him. His Mexican friends gave him drugs and "jumped" him into a Mexican gang. Felipe was frequently in fist fights with Mexican gangmembers. Mexican gangmembers frequently attempted to murder Felipe. Felipe reached rockbottom when he purchased a lethal firearm while addicted to crack cocaine, PCP, and alcohol; and Felipe had to choose if he would become a killer OR not.</p>
 
<p>A white man named Father <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Boyle">Greg Boyle</a> helped Felipe Esparza quit drugs. A white Irish man at a bar asked Felipe "Felipe, what are your 5 long-term goals?" Felipe said "I never had a father figure. That one simple question changed my life. I realized I didn't want to be a killer. I wanted to be a comedian." [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGooLR6kckY">1</a>]</p><hr>
  
<p>When I was 6-11 years old, my sister performed a horrible "prank" on me. It was nighttime. I was having a hot shower in my bathroom. My bathroom doorknob was <a href="https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/63ff138e-0395-4c15-b6a5-0d3ff4788e8f/svn/defiant-privacy-door-knobs-t8610b-64_1000.jpg">this</a>. My sister unlocked my bathroom door with a U.S coin, and she waited patiently for me. I finished my shower. I turned off my hot showerhead water. The loud hissing sound of my showerhead stopped. I was standing there naked in my bathtub. BUT THEN, suddenly my sister kicked my bathroom door open. My sister pulled my shower curtains. The shower rod and curtains collapsed. My sister poured a <a href="https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/dcb61c19-81e8-41a2-85fa-3759b5b11433/svn/paint-buckets-lids-rg5700-64_1000.jpg">bucket</a> of room temperature water over my head and naked body. My sister ran away. She flipped my bathroom light switch off. My only lightsource dissapeared. I was standing there naked in the cold and darkness. I was shivering, yelling, and crying. I could not see anything. I didn't know what was happening. I could only hear my sister in the corridor laughing hysterically. My sister dumped room temperature water on me, but compared to my hot shower, it felt like ice cubes.</p><hr>
 
<p>Tomorrow I am going to share the second horrible "prank" my sister performed on me...</p><hr>
 
<p>For many years, my sister was addicted to crystal methamphetamine. My sister's crystal methamphetamine addiction began when she was atleast 11 years old. My sister went to rehab and successfully quit methamphetamine by her 18th birthday.</p><hr>
 
<p>When I was 11 years old, my sister arrived home with broken glass shards on her back. Her back was bleeding. No one knows why.</p>
 
 <p>At 27 years old, my sister accidentally drove her car into a fire hydrant. The fire hydrant exploded. There was a mountain of water. When asked what happened, my sister said "I drank a little bit of alcohol last night, but I wasn't hungover. I was simply tired and stressed from work. I am done drinking. Drinking is... I am over it. I drank too much this year. It's not fun anymore."</p>
 
 <p>To this day my sister still drinks alcohol.</p><hr>
 
 <p>When I was 11 years old, my sister witnessed a murder. Two cops appeared at my house to ask my sister a few questions regarding the murder. My sister was high on meth. My sister removed her garments and ran away. My sister was running naked on the streets with no clothes on. The two cops said "You're not in trouble," but my sister yelled "SEXUAL ABUSE! FUCK PIGS! COPS ARE RAPISTS!"</p>
 
 <p>My uncle accidentally crashed his car into a sidewalk. His car flipped over and he almost died. He claims he was neither drunk nor high. During the same year, my uncle was driving while I was in the passenger seat. A black vehicle crashed into us. We got picked up by a Tow Truck. My uncle recognized the Tow Driver's passenger. Immediately, the Tow Driver said "You each are getting $3,000. All you have to do is call THIS number. Tell him I sent you. Just tell them your back hurts."</p>
