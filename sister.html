<h1>Why I Hate My Sister</h1>
<p>When I was 6-11 years old, my sister performed a horrible "prank" on me. It was nighttime that I was having a hot shower in my bathroom. door with a U.S coin, and she waited patiently for me to finish my hot shower. I finished my shower. I turned off the hot water and suddenly my bathroom became very quiet. The loud hissing sound of my showerhead stopped. I was standing there naked in my steamy baththroom. BUT THEN, suddenly my sister kicked my bathroom door open. My sister carried a 5 gallon bucket half-filled with room temperature water. My sister pulled my shower curtains. My sister dumped 2.5 gallons of water on me. I was shivering, yelling, and crying. My sister ran away laughing. But before leaving, she turned off my 800 lumens lightbulb. I was standing naked in the cold and darkeness. I could not see anything. I didn't know what was happening. I could only hear my sister laughing like a maniac.</p>
