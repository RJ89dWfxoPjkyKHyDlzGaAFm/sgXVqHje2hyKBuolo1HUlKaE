<h1>I Hate My Sister</h1>
 
 <p>My name is Jovanny Rodriguez. I am Mexican-American Chicano heritage. I am racist against my own skin color. I want to share my story of How I Became Racist Against My Own Skin Color. The thesis of my story is NOT that I hate my sister. My thesis is that every Mexican in my life has either dissapointed or disheartened me.</p>
 
<p>The Mexican comedian named Felipe Esparza had a similar experience as me. Felipe Esparza was addicted to drugs, but one day he realized every Mexican ruined his life. His Mexican father abandoned him. His Mexican friends gave him drugs and "jumped" him into a mexican gang. Felipe was frequently in fist fights with Mexican gangmembers. Mexican gangmembers frequently attempted to murder Felipe. Felipe reached rockbottom when he purchased a gun while addicted to crack cocaine, PCP, and alcohol; and Felipe had to choose if he would become a killer OR not.</p>
 
<p>A white man named Father Greg Boyle helped Felipe Esparza quit drugs. A white Irish man at a bar asked Felipe "Felipe, what are your 5 long-term goals?" Felipe said "I never had a father figure. That one simple question changed my life. I realized I didn't want to be a killer. I wanted to be a comedian."</p>
  
<p>When I was 6-11 years old, my sister performed a horrible "prank" on me. It was nighttime that I was having a hot shower in my bathroom. door with a U.S coin, and she waited patiently for me to finish my hot shower. I finished my shower. I turned off the hot water and suddenly my bathroom became very quiet. The loud hissing sound of my showerhead stopped. I was standing there naked in my steamy baththroom. BUT THEN, suddenly my sister kicked my bathroom door open. My sister carried a 5 gallon bucket half-filled with room temperature water. My sister pulled my shower curtains. The shower rod and curtains collapsed. My sister dumped 2.5 gallons of water on me. My sister ran away laughing. But before leaving, she turned off my only lightsource, my 800 lumens lightbulb. I was standing naked in the cold and darkness. I was shivering, yelling, and crying. I could not see anything. I didn't know what was happening. I could only hear my sister laughing like a maniac. The water my sister dumped on me was room temperature, but compared to my hot shower, it felt like ice cubes.</p><hr>
 
 <p>Tomorrow I am going to share the second horrible "prank" my sister performed on me...</p><hr>
 
 <p>My sister was addicted to crystal methamphetamine for many years. My sister's crystal methamphetamine addiction began when she was atleast 11 years old. My sister went to rehab and successfully quit methamphetamine at 18 or 21 years old.</p>
 
 <p>When I was 11 years old, I was at my house playing videogames. Two cops knocked on my house door. My mom told me to go to my room. As soon as my sister saw the cops, my sister removed all her garments and ran away. My sister was running naked on the streets with no clothes on. The cops were there to arrest my sister, BUT everytime one of the cops approached her, my sister yelled "SEXUAL ABUSE! FUCK PIGS! COPS ARE RAPISTS!" </p>
