<h1>I Hate My Sister</h1>
 
 <p>My name is Jovanny Rodriguez. I am Mexican-American Chicano heritage. The thesis of my story is NOT that I hate my sister. My thesis is that every Mexican rolemodel in my life has either dissapointed or disheartened me.</p>
 
<p>The Mexican comedian named Felipe Esparza had a similar experience as me. His Mexican father abandoned him. His Mexican friends gave him drugs and "jumped" him into a Mexican gang. Felipe was frequently in fist fights with Mexican gangmembers. Mexican gangmembers frequently attempted to murder Felipe. Felipe reached rockbottom when he purchased a lethal firearm while addicted to crack cocaine, PCP, and alcohol; and Felipe had to choose if he would become a killer OR not.</p>
 
<p>A white man named Father <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Boyle">Greg Boyle</a> helped Felipe Esparza quit drugs. A white Irish man at a bar asked Felipe "Felipe, what are your 5 long-term goals?" Felipe said "I never had a father figure. That one simple question changed my life. I realized I didn't want to be a killer. I wanted to be a comedian." [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGooLR6kckY">1</a>]</p>
 
<p>During 2013, I was a teenager at High School. I was smoking marijuana with my mexican "friend."d "Wait. I see my friend walking. I'll be right back." My friend ran.  "Whose marijuana is this? My friend wants to buy some." I replied "Okay. Bring him over. He can smoke with us." A few minutes later, a Mexican man arrived and sat next to me. He grabbed my container of marijuana, and said "I just want to purchase a small amount. I can't pay you here. The cops might see." He walked away with my marijuana and said "Follow me." I was a naive person. I assumed this was a paranoid man with bad manners. I didn't have a choice. I followed him a few yards away. He dissapeared around a corner building. When I reached the building.
  
  During 2017, I was technically homeless. I lived next to a Walmart. I was standing beside a barbershop, when a random black man grabbed all my belongings. He grabbed my backpack accussing me of stealing from his truck. The black man looked through my backpack and saw nothing. Suddenly, I was surrounded by a group of black men. One black man told me "Get the f***k out here. LEAVE." A Mexican man threatened to rape me. My own skin color threated to do horrible things to me. During my homelessness, my only real friends were white people. Every homeless colored person I encountered was a gangster. Every homeless white person had visible mental illnesses that prevented them from having real jobs. My white friend Larry was a nice man, he was addicted to drugs, but quit. He was 60 years old. Everytime he said a bad word he looked up at the sky and apoligized to God. </p><hr>
 
  
<p>When I was 6-11 years old, my sister performed a horrible "prank" on me. It was nighttime. I was having a hot shower in my bathroom. My bathroom doorknob was <a href="https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/63ff138e-0395-4c15-b6a5-0d3ff4788e8f/svn/defiant-privacy-door-knobs-t8610b-64_1000.jpg">this</a>. My sister unlocked my bathroom door with a U.S coin, and she waited patiently for me. I finished my shower. I turned off my hot showerhead water. The loud hissing sound of my showerhead stopped. I was standing there naked in my bathtub. BUT THEN, suddenly my sister kicked my bathroom door open. My sister pulled my shower curtains. The shower rod and curtains collapsed. My sister poured a <a href="https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/dcb61c19-81e8-41a2-85fa-3759b5b11433/svn/paint-buckets-lids-rg5700-64_1000.jpg">bucket</a> of room temperature water over my head and naked body. My sister ran away. She flipped my bathroom light switch off. My only lightsource dissapeared. I was standing there naked in the cold and darkness. I was shivering, yelling, and crying. I could not see anything. I didn't know what was happening. I could only hear my sister in the corridor laughing hysterically. My sister dumped room temperature water on me, but compared to my hot shower, it felt like ice cubes.</p><hr>
 
<p>Tomorrow I am going to share the second horrible "prank" my sister performed on me...</p><hr>
 
<p>For many years, my sister was addicted to crystal methamphetamine. My sister's crystal methamphetamine addiction began when she was atleast 11 years old. My sister went to rehab and successfully quit methamphetamine by her 18th birthday.</p><hr>
 
<p>When I was 11 years old, my sister arrived home with broken glass shards on her back. Her back was bleeding. No one knows why.</p>
 
 <p>At 27 years old, my sister accidentally drove her car into a fire hydrant. The fire hydrant exploded. There was a mountain of water. When asked what happened, my sister said "I drank a little bit of alcohol last night, but I wasn't hungover. I was simply tired and stressed from work. I am done drinking. Drinking is... I am over it. I drank too much this year. It's not fun anymore."</p>
 
 <p>To this day my sister still drinks alcohol.</p><hr>
 
 <p>When I was 11 years old, my sister witnessed a murder. Two cops appeared at my house to ask my sister a few questions regarding the murder. My sister was high on meth. My sister removed her garments and ran away. My sister was running naked on the streets with no clothes on. The two cops said "You're not in trouble," but my sister yelled "SEXUAL ABUSE! FUCK PIGS! COPS ARE RAPISTS!"</p>
 
 <p>My uncle accidentally crashed his car into a sidewalk. His car flipped over and he almost died. He claims he was neither drunk nor high. Later during the same year, my uncle was driving while I was in the passenger seat. A black vehicle crashed into us. The African-American male exited his vehicle and said "I am terribly sorry. I ran the red light." A white female yelled "Help! My baby!" The white woman ran in circles around the black vehicle, opening and closing differt doors. The African-American male said "The white woman is with me. She is my passenger. She has schitzophrenia. We don't have a baby, there is no baby in my car. But sometimes she calls me her babe."</p>
  
<p>We got picked up by a Tow Truck. My uncle recognized the Tow Driver's passenger. Immediately, the African-American Tow Driver said "You each are getting $3,000. All you have to do is call THIS number. Tell him I sent you. Just tell them your back hurts." I replied "Our accident wasn't that bad. I feel just fine. That would be lying." All three men stared angrily at me. The African-American took a deep breath and said "There is a thing called a "whiplash." You feel fine today, but in a few weeks or months you'll start to feel the effects." To be continued......</p>
