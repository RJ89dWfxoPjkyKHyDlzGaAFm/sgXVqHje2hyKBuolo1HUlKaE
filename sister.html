<h1>Why I Hate My Sister</h1>
<p>When I was 6-11 years old, my sister performed a horrible "prank" on me. It was nighttime that I was having a hot shower in my bathroom. door with a U.S coin, and she waited patiently for me to finish my hot shower. I finished my shower. I turned off the hot water and suddenly my bathroom became very quiet. The loud hissing sound of my showerhead stopped. I was standing there naked in my steamy baththroom. BUT THEN, suddenly my sister kicked my bathroom door open. My sister carried a 5 gallon bucket half-filled with room temperature water. My sister pulled my shower curtains. The shower rod and curtains collapsed. My sister dumped 2.5 gallons of water on me. My sister ran away laughing. But before leaving, she turned off my only lightsource, my 800 lumens lightbulb. I was standing naked in the cold and darkness. I was shivering, yelling, and crying. I could not see anything. I didn't know what was happening. I could only hear my sister laughing like a maniac. The water my sister dumped on me was room temperature, but compared to my hot shower, it felt like ice cubes.</p>
 
 <p>Tomorrow I am going to share the second horrible "prank" my sister performed on me...</p>
