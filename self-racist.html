<p>I had 4 rabbits whom I raised since they were hairless newborns. In the beginning, my newborn rabbits did everything together. When one rabbit went to sleep, they all went to sleep together. When one rabbit woke up, they all woke up together. When one rabbit decided to drink their mother's milk, they all drank milk together. They seemed to have a hive mentality. When they slept, they all hudled in a corner keeping eachother warm.</p>
  
<p>I gave my rabbits everything. They had food, water, and shelter. I was never mean to them. I gave them space to roam free. All my rabbits were so happy and playful together. Then one day their personalities changed...</p>
  
<p>It was probably 2-3 months after they were born. One day I had them all roaming free. I was standing next to them. I was so happy to see them. My rabbits were running in different directions. I said to myself "My rabbits are hungry or thirsty." I gave them fresh food, and fresh water. They did not care about the food or water. Then I said "Well probably my rabbits are happy to see me. I will pat all them."
  
 <p>Suddenly, one rabbit was running around around me in circles. I sat down on the floor next to my rabbits. I put my hand in front of them. One rabbit was smelling my hand. He seemed to happy and curious. All my rabbits were making weird noises called honking. I thought they were happy to see me. And maybe they were happy to see me, because what happened next changed my life forever. What happened is. That one rabbit who was smelling my hands, he suddenly latched his teeth onto my arm, then he began vigourously humping my hand. He was literally raping my hand. His penis was out and everything.</p> 
  
 <p>Several days later, gradually their behavior became worse. My rabbits started fighting eachother. And they were straight up raping eachother game of thrones style. I was so sad. I blamed myself. I thought I was doing something wrong. I tried spending more time with them. But it just got worse and worse.</p>
  
  <p>At first, I did not want to put them in cages, because I believed it was animal cruelty to have rabbits in cages. When the fighting worsened, I put them all in separate cages.Then, one day two rabbits escaped their cages when I wasn't there. My rabbits were very motivated to kill eachother. When I found them, they were both back in their cages, but one of them his lip was bleeding a lot. I blamed myself for everything since I should have secured their cages better.</p>
  
 <p>I researched online why are my rabbits fighting. The internet just said I had to train my rabbits to stop fighting. But I tried so many times to train my rabbits to not fight. It never worked. I gave up traning them once that incident occured when my rabbit was bleeding.</p>
  
  <p>So then I noticed something crazy. It was only my MALE rabbits who were figthing and raping. My female rabbits were docile. My female rabbits never fought anyone. So then I did even more research online with this new information I discovered about my MALE rabbits. All of a sudden I was reading wikipedia articles. As it turns out, the reason why my rabbits were fighting is because of a chemical called testosterone. 95% of testosterone is produced in the testes. For many years scientists have known that testosterone makes animals violent and crazy. So humans started doing a thing called spaying and neutering to prevent unwanted births, but also to prevent sexually dimoprhic behaviours like territorial pissing. When you castrate animals, their personality changes.</p>
  
  <p>So finally when I castrated my male rabbits. It took a while for their hormones to dissapear. But eventually their personalities changed again when they stopped producing testosterone in the testes. My rabbits were relaxed, they weren't running around like maniacs, they were more civilized. They don't rape me anymore. However, they still fight, but they are not crazy about it anymore. I just think they fight as a learned behavior because of their past fights.</p>
  
  <p>So years later, I was reading random dumb things on the internet. I wanted to know why are humans so crazy, like why do we fight wars, why is there racism. So I was reading the UNODC Global Study on Homicide 2013 reports, on page 94 it said that 95% of all convicted killers in the world are MALE.</p>
