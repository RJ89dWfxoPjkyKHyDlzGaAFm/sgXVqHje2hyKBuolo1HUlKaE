<p>I am a heterosexual Chicano-American male. I want to describe the events in my life that formed my racist opinions. In summary, I became racist against my own skin color from realizing that every bad thing in my life was caused by latinos, but every good thing in my life was caused by whites. However, I ask that you would please erase your preconceived ideas of what it means to be racist. You think since I am racist, then I must be an anti-semitic Neo-Nazi who voted for Trump, etc. I do not believe in White Supremacy, since I do not believe in God, and White Supremacy is a religious view that God blessed Whites with the gift of consciousness meaning all other races are pests who appear and behave like humans but are not human at all. I do not believe in White Supremacy. I simply believe that colored humans are unevolved lifeforms who need the help from our government to instigate their evolution.</p>

<p>According to the U.S. government, Latinos are a White Race, due to a 23AndMe study that discovered Latinos are 65% European

This is called mestizos. I honestly believe the only reason I am smart is because of that 65% European DNA in my blood. The 65% European DNA in my blood is my White Privilege. Even though, everywhere I go because of my skin color, people are always thinking I am an ex-convict, a burglar, or a gangmember.</p>  
  
<p>I honestly don't care that one time I was walking in a white neighborhood and within minutes a police vehicle was there interrogating me. I was happy that the police were doing their jobs. It made me feel safe. There are memories in my mind where I wish those cops HAD BEEN there, but they were not there. For example, I wish a police was there when a Mexican man tried to rape me in a public park bathroom. Luckily, I got away. I never reported it to the police, because I was a young teenager. I didn't want my parents to know. So I hate it when people say "Omg the cops killed an innocent man who didn't have a criminal record," because all I can remember is how a Mexican man tried to rape me and he is still out there in the free world, and he doesn't have a criminal record because he never got caught.</p>
