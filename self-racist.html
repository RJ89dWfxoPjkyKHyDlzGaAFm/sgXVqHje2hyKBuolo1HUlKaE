<p>I am a male Chicano-American. I am going to explain why I hate my own race and skin color. Chicanos and Hispanics are in a weird situation. We are not black. We are not white either. Well actually according to the U.S. government, Mexicans are a White Race, due to a 23AndMe study that discovered Mexican-Americans are 65% European DNA 
<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/12/genetic-study-reveals-surprising-ancestry-many-americans">[1]</a> <a href="https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(14)00476-5">[2]</a>. This is called mestizos. I honestly believe the only reason I am smart is because of that 65% European DNA in my blood. The 65% European DNA in my blood is my White Privilege. Even though, everywhere I go because of my skin color, people are always thinking I am an ex-convict, a burglar, or a gangmember. </p>
  
<p>I honestly don't care that one time I was walking in a white neighborhood and within minutes a police vehicle was there interrogating me. I was happy that the police were doing their jobs. It made me feel safe. There are memories in my mind where I wish those cops HAD BEEN there, but they were not there. For example, I wish a police was there when a Mexican man tried to rape me in a public park bathroom. Luckily, I got away. I never reported it to the police, because I was a young teenager. I didn't want my parents to know. So I hate it when people say "Omg the cops killed an innocent man who didn't have a criminal record," because all I can remember is how a Mexican man tried to rape me and he is still out there in the free world, and he doesn't have a criminal record because he never got caught.</p>
  
<p>A long time ago, my biological sister was raped by a mexican gangmember named Salatiel. Both my parents were born in Mexico then as teenagers they moved to the United States. My parents met at a gas station during the 1990s. First they produced my bastard sister. Next they got married. Then they produced me. Finally they got divorced to this day, I don't know what caused their divorce. My mom never talked about it. Everytime I asked my mom she would say "If you love your dad so much, why don't you go live with him? I pay all the bills here." On my 18th birthdate my Dad had dinner with me and said "Okay son, now that you are a grownup, I want to tell you why your mom and I had a divorce."  </p>
