<h1>My Personal Anecdote</h1>
<p>I had 5 rabbits whom I raised since they were hairless newborns. In the beginning, my newborn rabbits were very friendly and docile towards everyone. Several months later, when puberty happened to my young rabbits, all my female rabbits remained very friendly and docile; but all my male rabbits were violently urinating, raping, and attacking each other game of thrones style. Here is a photo I found online of a rabbit who lost his eye from fighting other rabbits 
<a href="https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/15722/do-rabbits-fight-each-other-to-the-death">[1]</a>. This is how visciously my rabbits fought, but luckily they never lost their eyes.</p>
  
<p>I tried training my male rabbits, for them to stop fighting, but it was an utter failure. One time, a male rabbit latched his teeth into my arm and humped his erect penis on my hand. One time, a male rabbit attacked another male rabbit, there was blood on their lips. </p>
  
<p>The reason why I tried training them is because I was uninformed. I thought there was something that I was not giving them that they needed. I tried giving them the most expensive food, I gave them the purest reverse osmosis water, I gave them plenty of space to roam free, I gave them my daily supervision and attention.</p> 
  
<p>A long time ago, when my rabbits were still drinking their mother's milk, my friend asked me "Are you going to neuter them." I replied "No. That sounds barbaric and unnatural. I am just going to separate them by genders." Soon I changed my opinion.</p>
  
<p>After doing research online, I learned that male rabbits fight because of a chemical called testosterone. 95% of testosterone is produced by the testes. Castration significantly reduces testosterone and unwanted sexually dimorphic behaviours. Spaying reduces ovarian cancer in rabbits.</p>
  
<p>With this new information, I had all my rabbits spayed and neutered. The differences I noticed since their castration was they seemed docile and civilized, they expressed zero desire to rape. The castration didn't stop my male rabbits from being violent towards eachother, however, I believe this violence was a learned behavior from their fights in the past. My female rabbits remained the same, docile and friendly.</p>
  
<h1>Evidence</h1>
<p>According to Page 23 of "Booklet 1: Executive Summary, UNODC Global Study on Homicide 2019," it says "In 74 countries with available data between 2010 and 2017, women made up just 6 per cent of all people convicted of homicide," in other words 94% of killers worldwide are men. When I was reading this, I remembered how my male rabbits were violent, and I remembered how my female rabbits were docile. After more research, I learned that male rabbits are not the only animals who fight. Many species all around the world, it is always the males who fight while the women remain docile. Here is a small list I created as examples: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VWFreC4onI">beatles</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0yuOSUSEs">bison</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWtwxurMJNQ">elephants</a>, equine, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_akd-o3ppAE">giraffes</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCcLMNcWZOc">kangaroos</a>, rabbits, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez7RUSCUhzk">rams</a>, roosters, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a8ncofVDuY">snakes</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHuqeIP3_HQ">zebras</a>.</p>
  
<p>Then, I examined an infographic titled "Gender Prison Gap <a href="https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/11573.jpeg">[1]</a>," it says 93.2% of U.S. federal inmates are male. Then, I examined infographics by "Prison Policy Initiative <a href="/prisonpolicy.html">[2]</a>," which says convict of any-crime, violent-crime, murder, and rape/sexual-assault is 89.85% male, 93.61% male, 93.35% male, and 98.54% male. Then, I examined data titled "Mapping Police Violence <a href="/mappingpoliceviolence.html">[3]</a>," from 2013 and 2019 it says 94.6% of humans killed by police were male victims.<p>
  
<p>Then, I examined "Death Penalty Info <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions/executions-overview">[4]</a>," from 1977 to 2019 it says 98.9% of U.S. death penalty victims were male.</p>
  
<p>Then, I examined "United States Sentencing Commission," it says Black females received 29.7% SHORTER prison sentences than white males <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/demographic-differences-sentencing">[5]</a>.</p>
  
<h1>My opinion</h1>  
<p>From all this evidence and other unlisted personal anecdotes, it became very clear to me that humans are a type of species no different than other animals. There are environmental factors such as testosterone, genetics, and evolution that dictates human behavior. Intelligence is caused by inheritance and random genetic mutations. Wealthy people are wealthy because their genetics blessed them with intelligence. Homeless people are homeless because their genetics cursed them with unintelligence. This means we should treat homeless people the same respect as you would a wealthy billionaire, because neither the homeless nor the wealthy decided their situation. Some people are lucky or unlucky in the genetics lottery.</p>
  
<p>I support neither #BlackLivesMatter nor #WhiteLivesMatter. Racism is a myth. When you look at the evidence, it is obvious that we do not have a racial issue. Racism is an excuse for black men and white men to kill, rape, pillage, and attack.</p>
