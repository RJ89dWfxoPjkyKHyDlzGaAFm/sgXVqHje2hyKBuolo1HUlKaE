<p>I am a male Chicano-American. I am going to explain why I hate my own race and skin color. Chicanos and Hispanics are in a weird situation. We are not black. We are not white either. Well actually according to the U.S. government, Mexicans are a White Race, due to a 23AndMe study that discovered Mexican-Americans are 65% European DNA 
<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/12/genetic-study-reveals-surprising-ancestry-many-americans">[1]</a> <a href="https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(14)00476-5">[2]</a>. This is called mestizos. I honestly believe the only reason I am smart is because of that 65% European DNA in my blood. The 65% European DNA in my blood is my White Privilege. Even though, everywhere I go because of my skin color, people are always thinking I am an ex-convict, a burglar, or a gangmember. </p>
  
<p>I honestly don't care that one time I was walking in a white neighborhood and within minutes a police vehicle was there interrogating me. I was happy that the police were doing their jobs. It made me feel safe. There are memories in my mind where I wish those cops HAD BEEN there, but they were not there. For example, I wish a police was there when a Mexican man tried to rape me in a public park bathroom. Luckily, I got away. I never reported it to the police, because I was a young teenager. I didn't want my parents to know. So I hate it when people say "Omg the cops killed an innocent man who didn't have a criminal record," because all I can remember is how a Mexican man tried to rape me and he is still out there in the free world, and he doesn't have a criminal record because he never got caught.</p>
  
 <h1>My Parents' Divorce</h1>
  
   
<p>When I was a teenager, I accidentally mentioned my dad in a sentence. My mother responded with "I pay all the bills here. You live underneath my house. If you love your dad so much, why don't you go live with him? Let me tell you something about your dad. Your dad was lazy. He never worked. All he did was drink alcohol and watched television. Your dad used to beat me up. Your dad owes child support." Somedays my mom would say "Your dad cheated on me one time, with Claudia." Other days my mom said "Your dad cheated on me two times, Claudia and Rosa." Other days my mom said "Your dad cheated on me a bunch of times with many different girls."
  
  
<p>On my 18th birthdate my Dad said "Okay son, now that you are a grownup, I want to tell you why your mom and I had a divorce. I met your mom at a gas station. I asked for her phone number. We dated. We made your sister. We got married. Then we made you. Your mom cheated on me. We divorced. I fought for child custody. My attorney convinced me into believing that children need mothers more than their fathers. Your mom won custody. I was allowed to see my children only twice a month on sundays. This is how our divorce began. I came back from work one day, your grandmother said 'Go ahead. He is there. Tell that honest man what you did.' Finally your mom confessed that she cheated on me with my bestfriend. I slapped your mom on her face and it was the only time I ever physically harmed her. I caused drama because I revengefully had sex with your uncle's wife. I became an alcoholic. One night, of heavy drinking, I parked my car outside my bestfriend's house, the one who betrayed me. I waited there the whole night intending to murder him. I fell asleep. The same night he flew out to Mexico."</p>
  
 <p>My dad continued "I wrote this song about my experience during the divorce <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkaF26DwO54">[3]</a>. That's me in the youtube video wearing the white hat. I wrote the lyrics years ago, when the divorce was happening. But it wasn't until years later, that I hired a band in Mexico called Super Rangers to create my song. I sang the lyrics and melody for them. And they added instruments and recorded my song in a professional music studio. It's not me who is singing in studio version. I paid them to sing it for me. I am the ghost writer of that song."</p>
  
<p>That same day my dad gave me a $1,000 merona wrist watch. He said "Now that you are 18 years old, I want you to have this as a family heirloom." But I declined my dad's offer. I guess this was my passive-aggressive way of telling my dad that I didn't want his money, I just wished he hadn't left me alone with my crazy mom." I asked my dad "When I was kid, I remember you used to pay child support. Then you stopped. Why did you stop paying child support?"
  
  <p>My dad replied "In the beginning I paid. But then I stopped because, your mom stole money from me. She tricked me. Because I didn't know how to read in English, your made me sign some legal papers so she stole all the money that I put into the house we used to own together. She said I was signing divorce papers, but it was lie. And your mom tried to make me jealous by buying a brand new red mustang car. And you know what else. Your mom was crazy. One time I visited your sister like the court said I had the right, your mom wasn't there, so I asked your grandmother if it was okay if I could take my daughter to have lunch with me. Your mom found out and called the cops on me. She told the cops that I kidnapped her daughter. And then she was yelling and caused a huge scene. And do you know what you mom said to me. She went to my car and said 'If you ever kidnap my daughter again, I am going to tell the cops that you molested my sister.' She threatened to lie to the cops so they could put me to prison. Your mom threatened me all the time."</p>
  
 <p>One random day I was remembering what my dad said to me, so I asked my grandfather "Which one cheated first, my mom or my dad?" My grandfather's eyes widened, he looked cautiously outside to see if my mom might be listening nearby. Then my grandfather said "I don't know who cheated first. But let me tell you something. I am not allowed to talk about your parents' divorce. If your mom found out I am telling you this, she will evict me. And I will be homeless. Your mom stopped caring about me on the day your grandmother died, because I am not related to you people by blood. A long time ago, you dad was just parked on the street. Your dad was not bothering anyone. I saw your mom picked up a brick and threw it at your dad's car and the window shattered. Your mom and dad are both crazy. That's all I have to say about it. Don't ask me anymore questions. I don't want to be involved."
 
  
<p>Going back to the conversation I was having with my dad. The last thing my dad said  "I learned from my mistakes. I don't have a grudge. I'm not mad at your mom or my bestfriend. If I saw either of them, I would shake their hands, and hope that they are doing okay. I don't hate anyone. I am friends with everyone... Well. Actually. There is only one person who I hate. And you know him as Salatiel..."</p>
