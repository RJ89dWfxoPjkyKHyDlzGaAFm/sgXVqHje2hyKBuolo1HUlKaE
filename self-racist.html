<p>I am a heterosexual Chicano-American male. I want to describe the events in my life that formed my racist opinions. In summary, I became racist against my own skin color from realizing that every bad thing in my life was caused by latinos, but every good thing in my life was caused by whites. However, I ask that you would please erase your preconceived ideas of what it means to be racist. You think since I am racist, then I must be a Neo-Nazi who voted for Trump, etc. I do not believe in White Supremacy, since I do not believe in God, and White Supremacy is a religious view that God blessed Whites with the gift of consciousness meaning all other races are pests who appear and behave like humans but are not human at all. I do not believe in White Supremacy. I simply believe that colored humans are unevolved lifeforms who need the help from our government to instigate their evolution. I do not believe we will fix society by building more schools or paying people to be unemployed. I want to fix society by exposing the truth about Racism. The truth about Racism, is that our society does not have an issue of Racism. The truth is our society has an issue of Men. Men are doing all the crimes in this world. In 74 countries between 2010 and 2017, men committed 94% of all homicides. And lets be honest, women who commit homicide are probably just killing the men who raped them, very few women are psychopaths. However, my opponents will argue that women are the real serial killers because women commit 54 million abortions each year. I do not believe in God, I support abortions. The reason I support abortions is because fetuses are unable to feel pain because they are essentially invertebrates until about 4 months. During abortions, I believe we need to administer barbiturates to the fetuses just in case. Our government needs to make it easy for women to have abortions. Traditionalists say "Our government's first responsibly is to protect our nation from internal and external violence." My response is human overpopulation is threatening to end all of humanity. In the year 2100, africans will be 39% of humans on Earth. White Nationalists will argue "Well, I don't care about Africans, I would rather let them all die." My response is it doesn't matter, Africans will take everything from you White Nationalists. They will destroy you, no matter where you run. Africans may not have nuclear weapons or high intelligence, but they do have something stronger than any weapon in existence. It is called Africans exist in our hearts. Everywhere you go, there are aryans who feel sorry and want to help the less fortunate. This means Africa will not destroy you with guns. They will destroy you with politics. One of these days they will wonder why do africans live in abject poverty, and why do whites live in beautiful Greek architectures. </p>

<p>According to the U.S. government, Latinos are a White Race, due to a 23AndMe study that discovered Latinos are 65% European 
<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/12/genetic-study-reveals-surprising-ancestry-many-americans">[1]</a> <a href="https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(14)00476-5">[2]</a>. This is called mestizos. I honestly believe the only reason I am smart is because of that 65% European DNA in my blood. The 65% European DNA in my blood is my White Privilege. Even though, everywhere I go because of my skin color, people are always thinking I am an ex-convict, a burglar, or a gangmember.</p>  
  
<p>I honestly don't care that one time I was walking in a white neighborhood and within minutes a police vehicle was there interrogating me. I was happy that the police were doing their jobs. It made me feel safe. There are memories in my mind where I wish those cops HAD BEEN there, but they were not there. For example, I wish a police was there when a Mexican man tried to rape me in a public park bathroom. Luckily, I got away. I never reported it to the police, because I was a young teenager. I didn't want my parents to know. So I hate it when people say "Omg the cops killed an innocent man who didn't have a criminal record," because all I can remember is how a Mexican man tried to rape me and he is still out there in the free world, and he doesn't have a criminal record because he never got caught.</p>
