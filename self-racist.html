<p>I had 4 rabbits whom I raised since they were hairless newborns. In the beginning, my newborn rabbits did everything together. When one rabbit went to sleep, they all went to sleep together. When one rabbit woke up, they all woke up together. When one rabbit decided to drink their mother's milk, they all drank milk together. They seemed to have a hive mentality. When they slept, they all hudled in a corner keeping eachother warm.</p>
  
<p>I gave my rabbits everything. They had food, water, and shelter. I was never mean to them. I gave them space to roam free. All my rabbits were so happy and playful together. Then one day their personalities changed...</p>
  
<p>I don't remember the exact timeline of events. However, it was probably 2-3 months after they were born. One day I had them all roaming free. I was standing next to them. I was so happy to see them. My rabbits were running in different directions. I said to myself "My rabbits are hungry or thirsty." I gave them fresh food, and fresh water. They did not care about the food or water. Then I said "Well probably my rabbits are happy to see me. I will pat all them."
  
 <p>Suddenly, one rabbit was running around around me in circles. I sat down on the floor next to my rabbits. I put my hand in front of them. One rabbit was smelling my hand. He seemed to happy and curious. All my rabbits were making weird noises called honking. I thought they were happy to see me. And maybe they were happy to see me, because what happened next changed my life forever. What happened is. That one rabbit who was smelling my hands, he suddenly latched his teeth onto my arm, then he began vigourously humping my hand. He was literally raping my hand. His penis was out and everything.</p>
