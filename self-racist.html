<p>I am Chicano-American. I am going to explain why I hate my own race and skin color. Chicanos and Hispanics are in a weird situation. We are not black. We are not white either. Well actually according to the U.S. government, Mexicans are a White Race, due to a 23AndMe study that discovered Mexican-Americans are 65% European DNA. This is called mestizos. I honestly believe the only reason I am smart is because of that 65% European DNA in my blood. The 65% European DNA in my blood is my White Privilege.</p>
