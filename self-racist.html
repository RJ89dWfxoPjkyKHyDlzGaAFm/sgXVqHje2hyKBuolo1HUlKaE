<p>I had 5 rabbits whom I raised since they were hairless newborns. In the beginning, my newborn rabbits were very friendly and docile towards everyone. Several months later, when puberty happened to my young rabbits, all my female rabbits remained very friendly and docile; but all my male rabbits were violently urinating, raping, and attacking each other game of thrones style.</p>
  
<p>I tried training my male rabbits, for them to stop fighting, but it was an utter failure. One time, a male rabbit latched his teeth into my arm and humped his erect penis on my hand. One time, a male rabbit attacked another male rabbit, there was blood on his lip.</p>
  
<p>The reason why I tried training them is because I was uninformed. I thought there was something that I was not giving them that they needed. I tried giving them the most expensive food, I gave them the purest reverse osmosis water, I gave them plenty of space to roam free, I gave them my daily supervision and attention.</p> 
  
<p>A long time ago, when my rabbits were still drinking their mother's milk, my friend asked me "Are you going to neuter them." I replied "No. That sounds barbaric and unnatural. I am just going to separate them by genders."</p>
  
<p>After doing research online, I learned that my male rabbits were fighting because of chemical called testosterone. 95% of testosterone is produced by the testes. Castration significantly reduces testosterone and unwanted sexually dimorphic behaviours. Spaying reduces ovarian cancer in rabbits.</p>
  
 <p>With this new information, I had all my rabbits spayed and neutered. The differences I noticed since their castration was they seemed docile and civilized, they expressed zero desire to rape. The castration didn't stop my male rabbits from being violent towards eachother, however, I believe this violence was a learned behavior from their fights in the past.</p>
  
<p>Page 94 figure 5.6 of "Global Study on Homicide 2013," it says 95% of convicted killers are men. Page 23 of "Booklet 1: Exective Summary, UNODC Global Study on Homicide 2019," it says "In 74 countries with available data between 2010 and 2017, women made up just 6 per cent of all people convicted of homicide," in other words 94% of killers are men. When I was reading this, I remembered how my male rabbits were violent, and I remembered how my female rabbits were docile.</p>
