<p>I am a heterosexual Chicano-American male. I want to describe the events in my life that formed my racist opinions. In summary, I am racist against my own skin color because every bad thing in my life was caused by latinos, but every good thing in my life was caused by whites.</p>
  
 <h1>How I became friends with Thomas</h1>
<p>Thomas was the first white person I ever encountered. I was probably 10 years old. Thomas was my neighbor. One summer day, I was playing a real life game with my male cousin, where basically it was just me pretending as if I was a soldier fighting zombies. My older latino uncle said "You should invite the new kid nextdoor to play, that way he will have friends too. He is the same age as you." This was the strangest opinion that I ever heard. I felt that it was a challenge or a dare. My uncle pointed at the house nextdoor. There was kid there. I yelled "HEY!" Thomas walked up to me and said "sup dude." I said "Want to hang out?" Thomas said "Let me ask my dad." Thomas was helping his dad unpack boxes into their new house. His dad was so happy to see Thomas was making friends that his dad said "Go ahead Thomas," with a smile on his face. This was how me and Thomas became friends.</p>  
  
 <h1>Thomas's Parents Were Former Drug Addicts</h1> 
<p>Eventually, I convinced my mom to let me go to Thomas's house. Thomas's house had a weird vibe. It smelled like cigarettes. His mom was sitting there smoking cigarettes. His dad would never stop talking. His dad would tell stories by singing. His dad was holding a photo of Thomas. His dad was singing "Hello I am his father. This is my son. Who I love so much. This is our photo of Thomas playing baseball." Thomas's parents confessed they were former drug addicts of methamphetamine, they quit meth because they wanted to give Thomas a better life.</p>
  <h1>Thomas</h1>
 <p>One day Thomas suspiciously asked me "Do you have a computer?" I walked Thomas to a desktop computer. Thomas and I were alone. I didn't even know how to use a computer. But Thomas was there clicking on all types of websites playing videogames. Then    
  
  
<p>According to the U.S. government, Latinos are a White Race, due to a 23AndMe study that discovered Latinos are 65% European 
<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/12/genetic-study-reveals-surprising-ancestry-many-americans">[1]</a> <a href="https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(14)00476-5">[2]</a>. This is called mestizos. I honestly believe the only reason I am smart is because of that 65% European DNA in my blood. The 65% European DNA in my blood is my White Privilege. Even though, everywhere I go because of my skin color, people are always thinking I am an ex-convict, a burglar, or a gangmember.</p>  
  
<p>I honestly don't care that one time I was walking in a white neighborhood and within minutes a police vehicle was there interrogating me. I was happy that the police were doing their jobs. It made me feel safe. There are memories in my mind where I wish those cops HAD BEEN there, but they were not there. For example, I wish a police was there when a Mexican man tried to rape me in a public park bathroom. Luckily, I got away. I never reported it to the police, because I was a young teenager. I didn't want my parents to know. So I hate it when people say "Omg the cops killed an innocent man who didn't have a criminal record," because all I can remember is how a Mexican man tried to rape me and he is still out there in the free world, and he doesn't have a criminal record because he never got caught.</p>
