<p>I am a male Chicano-American. I am going to explain why I hate my own race and skin color. Chicanos and Hispanics are in a weird situation. We are not black. We are not white either. Well actually according to the U.S. government, Mexicans are a White Race, due to a 23AndMe study that discovered Mexican-Americans are 65% European DNA 
<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/12/genetic-study-reveals-surprising-ancestry-many-americans">[1]</a> <a href="https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(14)00476-5">[2]</a>. This is called mestizos. I honestly believe the only reason I am smart is because of that 65% European DNA in my blood. The 65% European DNA in my blood is my White Privilege. Even though, everywhere I go because of my skin color, people are always thinking I am an ex-convict, a burglar, or a gangmember. </p>
  
<p>I honestly don't care that one time I was walking in a white neighborhood and within minutes a police vehicle was there interrogating me. I was happy that the police were doing their jobs. It made me feel safe. There are memories in my mind where I wish those cops HAD BEEN there, but they were not there. For example, I wish a police was there when a Mexican man tried to rape me in a public park bathroom. Luckily, I got away. I never reported it to the police, because I was a young teenager. I didn't want my parents to know. So I hate it when people say "Omg the cops killed an innocent man who didn't have a criminal record," because all I can remember is how a Mexican man tried to rape me and he is still out there in the free world, and he doesn't have a criminal record because he never got caught.</p>
  
<p>A long time ago, my biological sister was raped by a mexican gangmember named Salatiel. Both my biological parents were born in Mexico, then as teenagers they moved to the United States. They married eachother but eventually divorced. To this day, I don't know what caused their divorce. My mom never talked about it. Everytime I asked my mom she would make a grimace and then ignored me. One random day my sister mentioned to me that our parents had a miscarriage one time, and that my dad used to force dogs to fight as a bloodsport. As a teenager, I realized my mother became talkative when she would drink alcohol, so one day I asked my drunk mother "Is it true that my dad used to force dogs to fight as a bloodsport?" My drunk mother replied "I pay all the bills here. You live underneath my house. If you love your dad so much, why don't you go live with him? Let me tell you something about you dad. Your dad was lazy. He never worked. All he did was drink alcohol and watch television. Your dad used to beat me up. Your dad owes child support." Then I replied "But mom, what about the dogs? Did he make them fight?" My mom replied "Yes. It's true. He used to make some dogs fight." Somedays my mom would say "Your dad cheated on me many times with a bunch of different girls." Other days my mom said "Your dad cheated on me with just one girl, her name was Rosa, and she was our neighbor." Other days mom said "Your dad cheated on me two times." On my 18th birthdate my Dad had dinner with me and said "Okay son, now that you are a grownup, I want to tell you why your mom and I had a divorce." </p>
  
<p>My dad continued "I saw your mom at a gas station. I asked for her phone number. We dated. We made your sister. We got married. Then we made you. Your mom cheated on me. We divorced. Your mom won custody. And now ever since then I had joint custody of you and your sister. I was allowed to visit my children twice a month, every other sunday. Do you have any questions for me? Did your mom tell you anything about our divorce?" I replied "My mom said that she is innocent and that you're the one who cheated on my mom." 
  
<p>My dad continued "No. Your mom cheated on me first. Ask anyone. Ask your grandma, your cousin, your uncle, your grandpa. Everyone knows your mom cheated on me first. Here is what happened. One day I came back from work, and I saw your grandmother was angrily saying to your mom 'Go ahead. He is there. Tell that honest man what you did.' Your mom's family members were there too, and they were all acting very suspicious including your mom. Finally your mom confessed that she cheated on me with my bestfriend. I was angry. So I had sex with your uncle's wife. I know it was immature."</p>
  
 <p>My dad continued "During our divorce, I was a different person. I was foolish. There was an entire month that all I did was drink vodka every single day. So one night, I got drunk and drove to my friend's house. The one who your mom cheated with. I waited there the whole night. I wanted to catch him leaving his house or car. I was going to kill him. Seriously. I was messed up. Lucky he didn't leave his house. I fell asleep. That same night he flew out to Mexico, I didn't see him until years later."</p>
  
 <p>My dad continued "I learned from my mistakes. I don't have a grudge. I'm not mad at your mom or my bestfriend. If I saw either of them, I would shake their hands, and hope that they are doing okay. I wrote this song about my experience during the divorce <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkaF26DwO54">[3]</a>. That's me in the youtube video wearing the white hat. I wrote the lyrics years ago, when the divorce was happening. But it wasn't until years later, that I hired a band in Mexico called Super Rangers to create my song. I sang the lyrics and melody for them. And they added instruments and recorded my song in a professional music studio. It's not me who is singing in studio version. I paid them to sing it for me. I am the ghost writer of that song."</p>
