<h1>Art of Storytelling</h1>
<p>"Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events. Small minds discuss people." Some of you are not easily convinced by facts and logic, but you require stories to form your world view. This section is dedicated to you small minded people. Henry Winkler described the art of story telling as "We illuminate life, I mean that's the reason that we do what we do, is that we hold a mirror up to the rest of society. <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/yz0bjLk9rUo?t=155">1</a>"</span> I am not venting with my stories, but I selected these stories as to illuminate the reader.</p>

<p>For example, I grew up watching Law & Order, and an episode really impacted me when the detective said "You're going to prison for drug charges," the suspect replied "What difference will that make? I am already a prisoner in my own body." The suspect was a bedridden disabled person. During my youth, I missed out on a significant portion of my life due to chronic pain, I truly felt like I was "a prisoner in my own body." That is what Henry Winkler meant when he said "hold a mirror up to the rest of society," we see aspects of our own personality in those characters.</p>
