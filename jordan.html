<p>This STORY is fucking crazy!!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7dkgy/he-was-seen-cycling-naked-through-a-housing-estate-and-then-he-vanished">https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7dkgy/he-was-seen-cycling-naked-through-a-housing-estate-and-then-he-vanished</a></p>



<p>The 14 year old boy, Noah Donohoe was last seen riding his bicycle while naked, and a few days later, his naked dead body was found inside a storm drain, and the very last person Noah Donohoe messaged is <b>Jordan Peterson</b>!!!</p>

<p>Jordan Peterson is a zionist who loves jews. That's why nazis believe Jordan Peterson is guilty of raping Noah Donohoe, and that's why the news refuses to talk about it. You can only find reports on small websites like VICE.COM.</p>

<p>According to VICE.COM, the police believe it was not Jordan Peterson, but actually it was a man <b>pretending</b> to be Jordan Peterson.</p>

<p>VICE.COM also says Jordan Peterson's targeted audience is <b>young men</b>.</p>

<p>Whoever killed Noah Donohoe took advantage of Jordan Peterson, because Jordan Peterson says sh*t like "Young men need <b>role models</b>."</p>

<p>Other theories include death by accident or suicide.</p>

<hr>

<p>Jordan Peterson wrote a controversial essay.</p>
