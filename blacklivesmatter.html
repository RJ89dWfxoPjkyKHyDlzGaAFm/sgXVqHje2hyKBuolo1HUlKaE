<h1>Black Lives Matter</h1>
<p>Hello. I am an African American. I support the Black Lives Matter movement. These are my beliefs.</p>
<p>Even though whites ended slavery in 1834. And even though Blacks still practice slavery in 2020. I still believe that the United States contains the most black slaves in the world. The United States Prison System is corrupt. It was designed to disproportionately incarcerate Blacks and put them to work to make a profit for whites. 15% of all federal prisoners are there for non violent drug offenses. I believe that all non violent drug offenders in prison are innocent and should be let out into the free world so that these drug addicts could be homeless and breed uncontrollably until whites are the minority. There will be a lot of homeless crack babies. The Black Lives Matter Movement will establish federal socialism to steal money from rich White Jews like Mark Zuckerberg, and give the money to feed and house all these infinite homeless crack babies. When all the money runs out we will just print more money to destroy the U.S. government and finally acquire revenge for what the Whites did to us. It will be a glorious day when money becomes obsolete. Humanity will finally return to the way things were supposed to before Whites corrupted everyone. Everything used to be free. God left humanity with food and water everywhere. But whites went around and collected all the commodities to make a profit and turn people into slaves. Blacks are the truest descendants of Israelites.</p>
