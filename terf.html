<h1>The Main Story</h1>
<p>When I was 19 years old, I saw money on the sidewalk, and I told a woman "Excuse me, you dropped your money!" Suddenly, the woman ran away from me at 100mph! I was so confused. I picked up the money from the floor, I counted it, I pulled out my wallet, and my receipts, and that's when I realized "Wholly shit, this was MY OWN money that I accidentally dropped when I was walking towards the store!! And I found it walking back home the same path!" So that's when I realized. Wholly shit dude, that woman thought I was setting her up to get RAPED!!! That's why she ran away from me!!</p>
<h1>Learned My Lesson</h1>
<p>I barely learned men are not allowed to approach women. I never knew that. Because all my life I was being taught in school, youtube, and podcasts, that "men and women are equal", and that I should "treat men and women equally". So I always treated men and women equally. If I told a man "Hey dude, you dropped your money" he would reply "Thanks man!"</p>

<h1>My Dad Stole $200</h1>
<p>This is the REAL reason why I chased the woman to tell her that she dropped her money on the ground.</p>
<p>When I was 12 years old, my dad found $200 on the parking lot ground, and then he walked me to a MetroPCS store. 10 minutes later, a woman entered the MetroPCS store and announced in a very loud voice "Hello, please has anyone seen $200, laying on the ground nearby here? I must have accidentally dropped it!" I yelled "OH YEAH DADDY!" My dad pinched my arm so hard, I was about to cry, and then my dad publicly annouced in front of the whole store "No, I haven't seen any money around here." I was in complete and utter shock. 5 minutes later, we left the store, and we walked passed by the woman, and I heard her arguing with someone about her missing $200, and I don't know, I just got this bad feeling, like she really needed that money, and if she didn't get that money, she was going to be evicted from her house, because she was dressed in poor people's clothes. We went in our car, and I told my dad "Why didn't you give her the money?" My dad replied "Because I was too embarrased." That's fucking bullshit.</p>
<p>So yeah, that's why I chased the woman to tell her she dropped her money, because I remembered that one time, my dad stole $200.</p>
