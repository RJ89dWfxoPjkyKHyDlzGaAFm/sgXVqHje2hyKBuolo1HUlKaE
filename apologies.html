<h1>Crocodile Tears</h1>
<p>"Acceptance of Responsibility" is the most racist & mysoginistic law in existence today. It means that if you visibly cry in front of a judge, by law that judge is required to give you a shorter prison sentence because you "demonstrated sincere remorse and therefore are less likely to re-offend." In other words, judges are judging you based on your appearance, manners, and attitude. All you need is to act sad, and say things like "I am deeply ashamed of my actions. I am sorry to the victim, and the victim's family. I deserve whatever punishment is given to me," and you will automatically receive less prison time. If you have two rapists, one rapist says "I'm sorry for my actions" and the other rapist says "That b*tch deserved it." The rapist who said "I'm sorry" will automatically receive less punishment, even for the same exact crime. A white criminal could say "I love golf, fishing, and boating. I am in college. I made a terrible mistake because I was drunk." And the judge will say "I know his apology is sincere because we share similar hobbies, and he reminds me of myself when I was young, and so I will give him less prison time." So basically if a black man walks into court with a bad attitude, he will automatically receive more prison time simply for having a bad attitude. And because whites and blacks have different cultures, whites always perceive blacks as having bad attitudes.</p>
<p>Acceptance of Responsibility causes false confessions due to plea bargains. If you plead guilty, you get less prison time, because everyone thinks you have "accepted full responsibility for your actions".</p>
<h1>No Apologies From Me</h1>
<p>You will never hear an apology coming from me. The best apology is to stop your bad behaviour. Don't say you are sorry to me. Show you are sorry with your actions. Your words mean nothing to me. I would rather hear someone say "I don't care, I'm not sorry, I'll do it again," than hear a fake apology.</p>
<h1>The Golden Rule</h1>
<p>"Treat others the way <b>YOU</b> want to be treated."</p>
<p>I hate the above rule. The better rule is below,</p>
<p>"Treat others the way <b>THEY</b> want to be treated."</p>
<p>For example, I wish random girls would smack my ass and kiss me, BUT if I treated girls the way <b>I</b> want to be treated, I will end up in prison for sexual harrassment. So that's why, I treat girls the way <b>THEY</b> want to be treated. Not the way <b>I</b> want to be treated. The majority of girls don't want to be sexually harrassed, so I don't do it.</p>
