<h1>Context</h1>
<p>This not about my gay cousin who I chocked. Instead, this is about the cousin who I was jealous of, because his parents were more involved in his life.</p>

<h1>Crazy Story</h1>
<p>I was 7 years old, in my grandmother's backyard, and all of a sudden, I saw my cousin throwing small pebbles at the sky. He told me "I bet you can't throw farther than me." I did not accept his challenge. Then, my cousin found and threw large chunks of broken concrete. Until finally, he picked up the largest piece, and hurled it at the sky again. And then, he quit and ran off.</p>

<p>Several minutes later, a floating head above the backyard fence yelled at me "Why are you throwing rocks at my house!" I felt so mortified, I was frozen stiff. I think he saw the innocence in my eyes, and he knew it wasn't me, because then he said "Please, let me speak to a grown up. I was sitting in my backyard, and all of a sudden a giant brick hit my six year old daughter on the head, her head is bleeding, she might have to go to the hospital." Suddenly, my cousin appeared, and the man said "Where are your parents?" My cousin replied "I'll go call them." My cousin ran and never returned. Minutes later, the man walked away. I walked away too. And that was the end of the story.</p>

<h1>Theories</h1>
<p>To this day I have no fucking clue what happened. I feel like maybe our neighbor saw rocks falling from the sky, and went overly dramatic, and made up this fake story. OR maybe the story is actually true. What if my cousin actually ruined this random girl's life forever.</p>

<p>You have to understand, Lennox is ghetto, many undocumented immigrants, we're not like those rich snobby white people, "You'll be hearing from my lawyers!" Much crime goes unreported. For example, "The Watcher" on Netflix, based on a true story, a white family received creepy text messages, all of a sudden, the CIA, CSI, FBI, and SWAT team showed up analyzing every detail. To this they still have 100 detectives trying to solve that case. That shit only happens in white neighborhoods. In Lennox, your daughter gets killed, end of story. Last time I saw a dog being murdered, called 911, they said "We only do humans" and hung up on me.</p>

<h1>Second Crazy Story</h1>
<p>I was 15 years old, smoking marijuna with a group on the side of a freeway. All of sudden, a group of teenage boys start hurling stones at the cars. Imagine this. You're driving 60mph on the freeway, all of sudden a brick smashes your window.</p>
