<p>The very first time I ever saw a white person, I was in elementary school. All my teachers referred to themselves as Mexican-American, latinx, or chicanx. One day, a mysterious white man named Mr. Leonard who played clarinet eloquently, visited my elementary school. Mr. Leonard gave every student a plastic instrument called a recorder. Leonardo spent weeks teaching us how to read music notes and play recorder. Leonardo taught us about mozart and beethoven. One day, Leonardo showed us a drum and wire called a Resonance Experiment, it moves powders into geometric patterns. Mr. Leonard explained, there are vibrations, everywhere, all around us. Music is vibration that moves our emotions. From this resonance experiment, there was a glow about Mr. Leonard's eyes. Even as a kid, I knew this much about Mr. Leonard's personality. Mr. Leonard was born into a wealthy society, acknowledging his own white privilege, he became evangelical to travel the world preaching God through music and education. Mr. Leonard picked my elementary school because we were needy, illiterate, latinos. In the end, Mr. Leonard introduced me to a white woman named Ms. Louanne.</p>
  
<p>Ms. Louanne had the same religious appearance like Mr. Leonard's. It was in their eyes, there was a glow like God was leading them. Ms. Luanne introduced the harp to us, which she eloquently played. She offered to teach us how to play the harp, but she only had about 12 harps. We had to write a response to the prompt "Why are you a good candidate for Ms. Luanne's music lessons?" Ms. Louanne asked our teachers to recommend their most suitable students. Somehow, I became a part of Ms. Luanne's pilot program that later became The Harps in Our Public Schools Project. During my school's lunch breaks with Ms. Louanne, I learned how to read music symbols. The first songs I played was "Hot Cross Buns" and "Ode to Joy." </p>
  
<p>One day, I saw Ms. Luanne cried because of a newspaper article. The journalist described my elementary school as a military headquarters residing nearby an airport, that every 3 minutes there was an airplane flying above my elementary school which added to the feeling of living in a warzone; when my elementary school was first established, it was constructed 5 feet below ground to soundproof the noise of airplanes. When the journalist first witnessed my elementary school, he believed there was a mistake with his directions. It didn't seem like a school for children, it seemed more like a nuclear bunker. Beyond the buried classrooms was a perimeter of thick galvanized steel bars. The journalist argued that my elementary school appeared and functioned essentially like a bunker, not to save humans from nuclear fallouts, but instead to save children from their neighborhood's violent street gangs such as MS-13. My elementary school's demographics was 90% Latinos and 4% African-Americans; 32% of families were living below the federal poverty line. The journalist said it's why free music programs like Ms. Louanne's are so important for these forgotten ghetto communities.</p>
  
 <p>Even as a kid, I sensed Ms. Louanne's resentment. Ms. Louanne felt like this story was stolen from her by a journalist who brandished it for a biased political news report. Most of all, Ms. Louanne didn't like the idea that people had donated money simply because they pitied colored people. To Ms. Louanne there was no biological differences between whites and colored people, she wished everyone would stop making this about race. Ms. Louanne didn't choose my elementary school because we were latinos, she chose my elementary school because she saw an opportunity to make a positive impact. Ms. Louanne's lessons wasn't a charity for colored people. She wished someone had written a new report about her amazing talented student musicians.</p>
