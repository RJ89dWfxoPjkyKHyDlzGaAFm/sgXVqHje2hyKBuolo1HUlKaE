<p>On this page I attempt to convince you that Black Lives Matter and White Nationalism are sex cults.<p>

<p>In 1952, Malcolm X's rhetoric was founded upon the Nation of Islam. In 1964, Malcolm X realized the Nation of Islam was literally a religious sex cult, he was disillusioned, and so he quit being a Black Lives Matter leader. Malcolm X said "The real reason that I am out of the Black Muslim movement, which I never told, I kept to myself, but the real reason is Elijah Muhammad, the head of the movement, is the father of eight children by six different teenage girls who were his private personal secretary. <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.smithsonianchannel.com/video/series/the-lost-tapes/59950">1</a>"</span>

<p>In 1961, Paul Schäfer started his own White Nationalist germanic-nordic utopia colony named Colonia Dignidad. It slowly devolved into a religious sex cult where Paul Schäfer molested 200 boys. Paul Schäfer was found guilty, served 5 years in prison, and died of old age in prison. A movie was made about it with Emma Watson titled Colonia <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/UBSMl343fsw">2</a>.</p>

<p>Black Lives Matter does not give a fuck about black women nor lgbt. Martin Luther King Jr authored an advice column for Ebony Magazine between September 1957 and December 1958. A boy asked Martin “I am a boy, but I feel about boys the way I ought to feel about girls. I don't want my parents to know about me. What can I do?” Martin replied with an extrememly homophobic response. You gotta read it, click here <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/advice-living-4">2</a>. Basically, Martin adviced him to please stop being gay, gay is a choice, seek a therapist.</p>

<h1>Genetics</h1>
<p>The average Latino is 65.1% European, 18.0% Native American, and 6.2% African <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.11.010">1</a>. Latinos contain so much European DNA, that the FBI categorizes Mexicans as a <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.fbi.gov/@@dvpdffiles/a/2/a2b2c0267dcd4a7ba6c2eef502413bdf/normal/dump_1.gif">1</a> White race of Mexican nationality.</p>

<p>The average African-American is 73.2% African, 24% European, and 0.8% Native American <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/12/genetic-study-reveals-surprising-ancestry-many-americans">1</a>. The majority of African-Americans have atleast one European grandparent. This effect is called miscegenation.</p>

<p>During Nazi Germany, people with atleast one Jewish grandparent were categorized as mischlinges <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mischlinge">1</a>. Logan Paul and Jake Paul are objective examples of mischlinges <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/vUAfl-h5fkc?t=205">1</a>.</p>

<p>Barack Obama's mother is white. Trevor Noah's father is white. Colin Kaepernick's mother is white. Jordan Peele's mother is white. Keegan-Michael Key's mother is white.</p>

<p>Every Black History month you encounter this list of famous black inventors <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/dc/d8/5cdcd85edc11fe6a80b35699f6cf191a.png">1</a>. The vast majority of black inventors are mischlinges of white ancestry. It's the sad truth we all must accept, african-americans owe their intelligence to being a crossbreed with Europeans. There is no correlation of intelligence with morality. Whites are smarter, this does not make whites less dangerous. Blacks are dumber, this does not make blacks more dangerous. Both whites and blacks are equally dangerous. For example, Edward D. Breen is a white man and CEO of DuPont. On August 2001, DuPont was exposed for dumping PFOA into a lake in Washington, USA. The lawsuit revealed, DuPont in the 1960s conducted private research which proved PFOA caused englarged livers in rats, rabbits, and dogs; proved that PFOA accumulates in the body resisting bio-degradation. In the 1970s, DuPont discovered it's factory workers had high blood levels of PFOA. In the 1980s, DuPont proved PFOA causes birth effects in rats, then Dupont discovered two of it's pregnant factory workers gave birth to defective human offspring. In the 1990s, DuPont had knowledge that it's local water supply was contaminated with PFOA, factory workers and citizens near the factory were diagnosed cancer because of PFOA. To summarize, over 4 decades DuPont had knowledge that PFOA is extremely toxic to humans, Dupont conspired to hide this evidence from the public, DuPont chose profits over the health of humans. Today 98% of all humans in the United States have detectable blood levels of PFOA <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.10598">1</a>.</p>

<h1>Value of Money</h1>
<p>A long time ago, a man learned that money and power attracts women; directly or indirectly. Ever since then, men have been obsessed with money and material objects. Without money, men feel hideous and ugly. When a man believes he is ugly, it makes his penis limp. When a man has verified symbols on social media, it allows him to message any woman he wants. Men don't want average women. Men want beautiful instagram models.</p> 

<p>El Chapo Guzman utilized all his wealth and power to invite his celebrity crush Kate Del Castillo into his home, and it actually worked <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/el-chapo-speaks-40784/">1</a>.</p>

<p>Scientists said violence occurs whenever low income men feel sexually insecure about their small bank account, so low income men overcompensate by acting extra tough and masculine <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0305-750X(00)00122-4">3</a>.</p>

<p>Mohammed Bello's wealth allowed him to house and feed each of his 86 wives and 150 offsprings <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwM1ncuYAAg">1</a> <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVhJFM1bsJ0">2</a>.</p>

<p>White men and Black men are fighting to control the world's money. If you control the money, you control women and sex. Within 319 years, Humans went from a population of 600 million to 7.7 billion <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/11/Annual-World-Population-since-10-thousand-BCE-for-OWID.png">3</a>. In 11,700 years, humans went from a population of 4 million to reach 600 million.</p>

<p>Of course, not all men are like this. However, it only takes one crazy person to wreak havoc on Earth. The September 11 attacks, it only took 5 people to murder 2,977 innocent civilians. The 2017 Las Vegas Shooting, it only took one person to injure 411 innocent civilians and murder 60 innocent civilians. The richest 1% own 44% of the world's wealth <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://inequality.org/facts/global-inequality/">1</a>. And who are the 1% percent? Men. In the Unites States, the richest 1% is almost entirely composed of men. Specifically, 95.5% of the richest 1% are men <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1536504220902196">2</a>. And examining Forbes' list of the richest women in the world <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinstoller/2020/04/07/the-top-10-richest-women-in-the-world-2020/">3</a>, you will notice 100% of the top 10 richest women in the world are not self made billionaires. The vast majority of the time when a woman is a billionaire it's because that woman inherited a wealth or business from a husband or a father.</p>

<h1>Greed of Slavery</h1>
<p>The truth of why White men purchased slaves, and why Black men sold slaves. Because every man has a sexual fantasy in their mind. This sexual fantasy involves purchasing a big house with luxuries because it attracts pornstars to have sex with. White men and Black men will do anything to accomplish this sexual fantasy, including purchasing and selling slaves.</p>

<p>A journalist named Michael Scott Moore was kidnapped by Somali pirates, he was captive as ransom for 2 years. While the average Somali citizen earned less than one dollar per day, Michael Moore observed Somali gangmembers owned fancy cars and mansions. One Somali gangmember bragged how every bullet on their belt cost one dollar each. Some joined gangs to avoid poverty, but Michael Moore observed the vast majority joined gangs because of greed. -18:15 <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/2FgoWxcdaVqfcGm77CXlNc">3</a></p>

<h1>African Men Sold Their Own</h1>
<p>"The historians John Thornton and Linda Heywood of Boston University estimate that 90 percent of those shipped to the New World were enslaved by Africans and then sold to European traders <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html">3</a>."</p>

<p>Nat Amarteifio is an African who said "The Europeans weren’t going out and capturing Africans. They couldn’t — they got sick and died from illnesses like malaria <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-08-20/willful-amnesia-how-africans-forgot-and-remembered-their-role-slave-trade">2</a>."</p> 

<p>24% of Nigerians possess the Sickle Cell trait <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/20890">1</a>. Sickle Cell trait provides 60% immunity against malaria <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/biology/index.html#tabs-1-4">2</a>.

<p>Africans sold slaves and killed elephants. According to Smithsonian, Africans have killed elephants since atleast the 1400s <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://africa.si.edu/collection/conservation/protect-ivory/">1</a>. In 1800 there were 26 million elephants in Africa <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/media/history-ivory-trade/">2</a>. In 1979 there were only 600,000 elephants. The purpose of killing elephants is to collect ivory tusk. Adam Ruins Everything is one of the most progressive liberal television shows on the internet. Even Adam Ruins Everything says that white people killing animals for trophy hunting is a minor issue compared to the systemic killing Africans commit to collect ivory tusk <a href=" https://youtu.be/YUA8i5S0YMU?t=65">3</a>. Africans sell ivory tusk to whites and chinese people, because some believe ivory tusk cures erectile dysfuntion. That is why in America you find these erectile dysfuntion pills everywhere called Rhino <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/media/108844/download">4</a>, it does not contain real ivory tusk, but everyone knows rhinos symbolizes virility. White men purchase ivory to cure erectile dysfunction, and African men sell ivory for the purpose of affording a big house and luxuries because it attracts pornstars to have sex with. And rhinos die because of it.</p>

<h1>Black Women</h1>
<p>"United States Sentencing Commission," says black women receive 29.7% SHORTER prison sentences than white men <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/demographic-differences-sentencing">1</a>.</p>

<p>"Mapping Police Violence," says 96.2% of african-americans killed by police are male victims <a href="../mappingpoliceviolence.html">1</a>.</p>

<p>32.2% of black men, 5.9% of white men, 5.6% of black women, and 0.9% of white women will be imprisoned <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lifetime-likelihood-by-race.png">5</a> <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=836">6</a>. Black women were slaves too, and yet Black women perpetrate fewer crime than Black men and White men. The crime statistics suggests every man on Earth is a potential threat <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*tF8MqygzkichswdWkK8nSA.png">6</a>.</p>

<p>Oluwatoyin Salau was an ardent supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5UsGk0GDRs">1</a>. In the end, Oluwatoyin Salau was raped and murdered by a black man named Aaron Glee Jr. Oluwatoyin Salau was murdered by the same black men who she attempted to help.</p> 

<h1>White Women</h1>
<p>White men invented slavery and forced White women to accept it. Until 1920, White women were forbidden from politics. This viral video shows a white woman doing a false police report against a black man. We called this White woman a murderer. But how are white women murderers, when it is always a white man pulling the trigger? 87.2% of police officers are male <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/tables/table-74">4</a>. What is White Privilege worth for women when all women are afraid of being killed and raped. Women are not allowed to leave their homes.</p>

<p>White women owned slaves, but her slaves were often gifts that white men offered <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/10/25/white-women-slaveholders-q-a/">3</a>.</p>

<h1>Afrocentrism</h1>
<p>A common afrocentric argument of how Europe ostensibly destroyed Africa. "Africa's primitive state gave Europeans the economic advantage. European merchants offered cheaper prices than African merchants, so African businesses failed. This put Africa in debt, and the only option Africa had to pay their debt was selling slaves. Africa would be advanced if Europe had left Africa alone."

<p>John Thornton debunked the aforementioned theory <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL454363W/Africa_and_Africans_in_the_making_of_the_Atlantic_world_1400-1680?edition=isbn_9780521398640">4</a>. Africans rarely purchased essential items from the Europeans, instead the Africans purchased nonessential "novelty items" such as metal knives, beads, mirrors, rum, and guns. In other words, African men sold slaves because of greed. According to John Thornton page 52, the historian Ray A. Kea compiled a list of the top 150 popular items in the Gold Coast that Africans purchased from Europeans, 47 out of 150 were items of clothing. Africans produced their own luxury clothing, and clothing was so afforable that even peasants owned clothes, but nobody wanted to dress like a peasant. Perhaps one reason why Africans spent so much money on clothes, John Thornton noted, is because Africans did not pay rent. There was no legal land ownership in Africa, if you wanted land in Africa, you simply took it by force and defended your own property.</p> 

<p>Great Britain imported 3,259,440 african slaves. The USA imported 305,326 african slaves. It's safe to say, Africans purchased clothing that was manufactured by african slaves.</p>

<p>Nike products are manufactured by sweatshops workers who were paid 15 cents per hour during 1997, and 89 cents per hour during 2003 <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nike-workers-pay-kaepernick/">1</a>. Adidas products are also manufactured in sweatshops.</p>

<p>The "woke" football player Cam Newton said "I've spent thousands and thousands of dollars, and maybe even millions of dollars on clothes that I only wore once <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/RVVEtORhT-4?t=185">1</a>." Wearing the same outfit more than once, Cam Newton calls it "recycling." Cam Newton said his New Years Resolution is to not buy high fashion. 88% of New Year's resolutions fail. The "woke" musician Drake spent $976,000 on one outfit <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/7pWCYUiU7zM?t=251">2</a>. The "woke" Lil Uzi Vert spent $24 million on one diamond on his forehead <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVIm3kvZcM8">3</a>. While these "woke" celebrities are worried about their outfits, meanwhile 2 billion humans on Earth don't have access to safe drinking water <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/drinking-water">4</a>.</p> 

<p>In 2020, some Indians boycotted Jeff Bezos, because Amazon.com's cheap prices allegedly caused Indian businesses to fail <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51117315">4</a>.</p> 

<h1>Invention of Slavery</h1>
<p>The idea of slavery started when humans were hunting and gathering. It started with an inspiration like "What if I could hit someone on their head, and force them to bring me food?" During hunter gatherer times, real slavery did not exist, because your slaves easily escaped.</p>
<p>Real slavery started around 10,000BCE during the agricultural revolution. During agriculture times, your slaves did not easily escape, because the only alternative of being a slave was being a hunter gatherer. Ancient people on different continents independently discovered and practiced slavery. "Code of Hammurabi" details slavery in ancient Mesopotamia from 1,754BCE <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/slavery-sociology/The-law-of-slavery">3</a>. "Laws of Manu" details slavery in ancient India from 100BCE. "Tang Code" details slavery in ancient China from 624CE. "Quran" details slavery in ancient Middle East from 632CE.</p>

<h1>Education</h1>
<p>During 2019, 110,812 female college students participated in this survey <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.aau.edu/key-issues/campus-climate-and-safety/aau-campus-climate-survey-2019">1</a>. 24% of verbal sexual harassment against female graduate students was perpetrated by college employees; such as a teacher, advisor, faculty, coach, trainer, etc. Depending on how rape is defined, 10.9% to 16.2% of female college students experienced a completed or an attempted rape. 73.3% of female college students said their rapist was a fellow college student.</p>

<p>How is college supposed to fix society, when the colleges itself is perpetrating sexual harassment? According to Global Study on Homicide, 34% of murdered women were murdered by their intimate partner, and "Men who kill their intimate partners have a markedly different profile to men who kill outside relationships, according to studies from several European countries. They tend to have better jobs and enjoy a higher standard of living than other perpetrators, and often have no criminal background. One study found that men who killed their partners were better educated than other homicide perpetrators and had fewer gaps in their employment history <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/global-study-on-homicide.html">1</a> <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1077801204265015">2</a>."</p>

<h1>Domestic Violence</h1>
<p>During 1995 to 1996, 8,000 women participated in a telephone survey <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/app/publications/abstract.aspx?id=172837">5</a>. It observed that 14.8% of women were victims of a completed rape, 2.8% of women were victims of an attempted rape. 22.1% of women were victims of a physical assault from an intimate partner. 8% of women had felt terrorized by a stalker. </p>

<p>During 2015, 5,758 women participated in a telephone survey <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nisvs/summaryreports.html">6</a>. It was learned that 21.3% of women were victims of either a completed or an attempted rape. 16% of women had felt terrorized by stalkers. 37% of women were victims of an unwanted sexual contact.</p> 

<p>According to liberals, education and income will solve all of the world's problems. But why is there sexual harrassment in college campuses? Why is there sexual harassment in the workplace? Why do rich men like Harvey Weinstein committ sexual crimes? The answer is simply no matter how much education and money you throw at the entire male race, all men are biologically hardwired towards greed and violence.</p>
