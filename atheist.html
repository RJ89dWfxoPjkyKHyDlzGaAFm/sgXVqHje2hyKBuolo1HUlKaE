<p>When I was a kid, I was taught the religion of Jehovah's Witnesses by my grandmother, aunt, and distant cousins. Every Sunday I visited church. My grandmother gave me a hardcover children's bible with realistic cartoon illustrations. As a kid, the only thing I understood about Jehovah's Witnesses was that I was not allowed to celebrate holidays. I was not allowed to celebrate christmas, columbus day, birthdays, halloween, valentine's day, thanksgiving, easter, etc. I was taught that all American holidays originated from Paganism which are false Gods. I was not allowed to pledge allegiance to the American flag. This was all great for me because in elementary school during holiday seasons all I had to do was say "Excuse me teacher, I don't have to do this crossword puzzle because it's against my religion." And all throughout october, november, and december, I didn't have to do crossword puzzles. And my first grade teacher Ms. Duran allowed this since she was afraid that I might punch and bite her. </p>
 
 <p>Then, in second grade my teacher was named Ms. Acuna. I tried to not do holiday crossword puzzles, but then Ms. Acuna said "I ain't never heard of no religion like that! I oughtta give you two crossword puzzles for trying to lie to me!" My new teacher was so mean to me, that I started crying. But I made sure noone saw me cry. So I sat there doing my holiday crossword puzzle feeling like I was going to hell for doing this.</p>
