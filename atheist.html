<h1>Atheist Christianity</h1>
<p>I am an atheist who worships God. Here's why.</p>
<h1>Art Is Meaningless</h1>
<p>If someone is strumming a guitar, do you say "Stop strumming that guitar! Can't you see? Your music is a meaningless social construct not based on science!" The guitar player replies "I know music is meaningless. That is precisely why I choose to stay alive and create music. Because fuck it. Strumming this guitar is makes me happy, dude."</p>
<h1>Church Is Meaningless Too</h1>
<p>I know God is a social construct, but I don't care, atleast church makes me happy. I love dressing up in my tuxedo and singing hallelujah alongside my friends and family.</p>
<h1>Pascal's Wager</h1>
<p>Just think about it. If God is fake, then it literally does not matter if you do OR do not worship God. Therefore, I choose to worship God, because it literally does not matter.</p>
<p><table><tr><th>Worship</th><th>Do Not Worship</th></tr><tr><td>Life is fun</td><td>Life is boring</td></tr></table></p>
<h1>Why Christianity?</h1>
<p>I don't enjoy concerts, parties, getting tattoos/piercings, so naturally, I am a conservative. I would rather stay at home and read a good old fashioned fictional book like the Holy Bible.</p>
<h1>I Am Prison Gay For God</h1>
<p>Worshipping God is different from believing in God. For example, you do not need to be gay to have gay sex. I know plenty of straight people who have gay sex, and they still identify as straight, not bisexual. For example, this black man in prison below.</p>

<h1>I Took The Blue Pill For God</h1>
<p>Imagine you are a straight man, living inside a straight man's prison. There is only one choice. All you can do is have gay sex. So you are a straight man having gay sex. That's how I feel. I am an atheist, living inside a meaningless prison world. If life is meaningless, I should just kill myself. I have two options, either I kill myself, or I worship a false God. I chose to worship a false God. Please, let me continue living inside The Matrix. They always talk about the lives christianity has killed, but they rarely ever mention the lives christianity has saved. Christianity saved MY life.</p>
<h1>Queen's Guard</h1>
<p>So that's why today I converted to Atheist Christianity. I love knowing my religion has a lot of hype and has been practiced for 2,000 years, and I am continuing that tradition. Makes me feel like I am part of something bigger. Being a christian is a life long commitment and I am dedicated to it. Being a christian feels like I am a Queen's guard. Yeah, I know my outfit looks ridiculous, but I am dedicated to my job.</p>

<h1>More Examples</h1>
<p>A human is reading a fictional book. The atheist says "Stop reading fictional books! You should only read non-fiction!"</p>
<p>A human is running a 26.2 mile marathon. The atheist says "Stop running! Can't you see? Running is pointless!"</p>
<p>A human is climbing Mount Everest. The atheist says "Stop climbing! Can't you see? Climbing is pointless!"</p>
<p>A human is playing a sport. The atheist says "Stop playing sports! Can't you see? It's all pointless!"</p>
<p>A human is cosplaying. The atheist says "Stop cosplaying! Can't you see? It's all fake!"</p>
