<p>God does not exist reason #one, You will literally die if you rehydrate with seawater <a href="">[1]</a>, 97.2% of Earth's water is seawater. Only 0.0091% of Earth's water resides in lakes and rivers <a href="https://www.usbr.gov/mp/arwec/water-facts-ww-water-sup.html">[2]</a>. Literally, 99.9% of Earth's water is mostly ocean water, groundwater, or it is frozen. If you tried drinking water from a river, lake, or well, you will literally be killed by a bacteria, parasite, or virus. If God truly loved humanity, he would have atleast left us with clean water to drink. But he did not. If God truly loved humans, he would have atleast written in the bible "Boil the water before you drink or else you will die," But God did not do that. Modern Germ Theory wasn't invented until the 1800s.<p>
 
<p>God does not exist reason #two, one in thirty-three infants born is deformed <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/data.html">[2]</a>. The most common defect is called Club-Foot. The second most common birth defect is called Down Syndrome. Why did God make birth defects so common? Why did God invent Club Foot and Down Syndrome?</p>
 
<p>God does not exist reason #3, the CDC recommends that all infants should be given Hepatitis B vaccine on the exact day they are born so that they will not die <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html">[3]</a>. The CDC recommendeds all humans to have atleast 50 doses of vaccines by the time they are 18 years old. You should have annual influenza vaccinations. The average lifespan in the USA is 78.9, so by the time you are 78 years old, if you are following CDC recommendations, then you would have recieved 110 vaccine doses, all this just so that you will not die. From the moment you are born, every single second God is trying to kill you. Why didn't God write instructions on how to create vaccines? The first vaccine wasn't invented until 1700s, so humans lived millions of years dying from all types of diseases and viruses. And now with this coronavirus you will likely need another annual vaccine according to WebMD <a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200504/--annual_covid-19-vaccine-may-be-necessary">[4]</a>.</p>
 
<p>God does not exist reason #4, 39.5% of all humans in the USA will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics">[5]</a>. Why didn't God write a cure for cancer in the bible?</p>
 
<p>God does not exist reason #5, the human body produces Vitamin D from the Sun, the Sun causes blindness, skin cancer, sunburns, sunspots, and wrinkles. </p>
