<p>When I was a kid, I was taught the religion of Jehovah's Witnesses by my grandmother, aunt, and distant cousins. Every Sunday I visited church. My grandmother gave me a hardcover children's bible with realistic cartoon illustrations. As a kid, the only thing I understood about Jehovah's Witnesses was that I was not allowed to celebrate holidays. I was not allowed to celebrate christmas, columbus day, birthdays, halloween, valentine's day, thanksgiving, easter, etc. I was taught that all American holidays originated from Paganism which are false Gods. I was not allowed to pledge allegiance to the American flag. This was all great for me because in elementary school during holiday seasons all I had to do was say "Excuse me teacher, I don't have to do this crossword puzzle because it's against my religion." And all throughout october, november, and december, I didn't have to do crossword puzzles. And my first grade teacher Ms. Duran allowed this since she was afraid that I might punch and bite her. </p>
 
 <p>Then, in second grade my teacher was named Ms. Acuna. I tried to not do holiday crossword puzzles, but then Ms. Acuna said "I ain't never heard of no religion like that! I oughtta give you two crossword puzzles for trying to lie to me!" My new teacher was so mean to me, that I started crying. But I made sure noone saw me cry. So I sat there doing my holiday crossword puzzle feeling like I was going to hell for doing this.</p>
 
 <p>By second grade I stopped going to church. When I was in middle school, I was walking next to a high school, and there was a random guy named Juan P there. Juan had dark skin, and he never stopped talking about God. He always had a guitar with him, and all his songs were about God. He told me his entire life story, he was morbidly obese, then he became anorexic. Juan mentioned he attempted suicide many times by laying down in the middle of the street at night. He said the only reason why he survived those suicide attempt was because God needed him to serve a purpose, and his purpose was to spread the word of God. Then he kept talking about how he was studying theology in college. Juan invited me to church. The church was weird because we all held hands and danced next to live hardcore metal music. I always thought hardcore metal music was the devil's music. And the way they danced, it was not appropriate with the music they played. It was more like they were dancing to Riders on the Storm by The Doors, because they were all staring at the ceiling holding hands in a circle like they were tripping on LSD. And there was a guy singing/screaming in a microphone "Jesus is the lord and savior!" Then I saw Juan played his guitar for a quinceanera, he was singing about God.</p>
 
 <p>Then in High School my friend Shawn invited me to different churches. But the weirdest church was at some random person's living room. They made me read a bible verse outloud. Then a guy went around touching people on their heads with his two hands. And everyone he touched, their eyes rolled back, they started speaking in tongues, then started convulsing like they were having an exorcism or a seizure.</p> 
 
 <p>Even though I was raised by Jehovah's Witnesses, I never onced believed in the Bible stories. But I still believed in something. I used to think that God was taking care of me. I thought my life was an awesome movie. I thought nothing bad could ever happen to me, because I was the main character in this movie. I used to think that all the adults in my life had it all figured out. I thought I was born in a world of peace. When I was a kid, I used to eat meat and I never knew where it was from. Since I thought adults figured everything out, it never crossed my mind that my food was bad for me. As a kid, every single day I ate potato chips. Nothing else just potato chips. And noone ever told me it was bad for me.</p>
 
 <p>Why God does not exist reason #one, for millions of years 99.9% of Earth's water remained undrinkable to ancient humans; only 0.0091% of Earths water exists in lakes and rivers <a href="https://www.usbr.gov/mp/arwec/water-facts-ww-water-sup.html#:~:text=3%25%20of%20the%20earth%27s%20water,water%20is%20available%20fresh%20water.">[2]</a>. 99.9% of Earth's water is mostly ocean water, deeply buried underground or it is frozen. If you were an ancient human, if you drank the river and lake water, you died from a parasite or bacteria. If God truly loved humanity, he would have atleast left us with clean water to drink. But he did not. If God truly loved humans, he would have atleast written in the bible "Boil the water before you drink or else you will die." But God did not do that. Modern Germ Theory wasn't invented until the 1800s, so humans survived millions of years never knowing why the pond water was making them sick. <p>
 
 <p>God does not exist reason #two, one in thirty-three infants born is deformed <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/data.html">[2]</a>. The most common defect is called Club-Foot. The second most common birth defect is called Down Syndrome. Why did God make birth defects so common? Why did God invent Club Foot and Down Syndrome?</p>
 <p>God does not exist reason #3, the CDC recommends that all infants are given Hepatitis B vaccine on the exact day they are born so that they will not die. The CDC recommendeds all humans to have atleast 50 doses of vaccines by the time they are 18 years old. You should have annual influenza vaccinations. The average lifespan in the U.S.A is 78.9, so by the time you are 78 years old, if you are following CDC recommendations, then everyone would have 110 vaccine doses, just to not die. My point is that every single second God is trying to kill you from the moment you are born. Why didn't God write instructions on how to crate vaccines. The first vaccine wasn't invented until 1700s, so humans lived millions of years dying from all types of diseases and viruses. </p>
