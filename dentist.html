<h1>Never look a gift horse's mouth.</h1>

<p>In the olden days, you might receive a horse as a gift, and you might look at the horse's mouth, because, you can guess a horse's age based on it's teeth. A young horse is worth more money. So that's why it is rude to look a gift horse's mouth.</p>


<p>One of the most common nightmares people have is their teeth falling out.</p>

<p>It means you are afraid of growing old.</p>

<p>Teeth symbolizes the volatility of life.</p>

<p>When I was young, my teeth were flawless, but now I am old, my teeth have holes, because of mistakes I made in my past, and I can never go back and change my past, I have to live with the mistakes I made.</p>

<p>So that's why I despise dentists.</p>
