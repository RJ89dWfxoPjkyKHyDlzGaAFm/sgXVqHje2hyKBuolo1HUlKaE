 <p>April 29, 2020. Today is not a good day for me.</p>
 <p>I am such a moron. I gotta rewrite the Mr. Hornstra story. It makes no sense! I hope I don't rewrite it and make it worse...</p>
 
 <p>Greetings my name is JovannyR. I love movies and music. Most of all I love telling great stories. Most of all, I love telling great stories. I am so dedicated about crafting great stories that I am willing to tell lies. I tries telling honest stories but sometimes the truth is just boring. So I take truths and create entertaining falsehoods. My website is a fake news website. But I try to find a balance of real news with fake news. One of my favorite lie is acting that I am a deranged nazi cartoon character.</p>

<p>Okay. I just realized my facts and statistics page makes no sense. </p>
 
<p>Okay. I am trying to write one on police vehicular pursuits. I am angry at liberals. 355 people die each year due to traffic pursuits, many are innocent bystander deaths. Liberals are so stupid. Instead of blaming the idiots who try to evade police. Liberals blame cops. Liberals are so stupid. They actually believe cops should allow drunk traffic violators such as Rodney King the right to evade police. All because they wanna save 355 lives. They blame cops. In reality, ANYONE who evades police should be killed on sight. EVADING POLICE IS ATTEMPTED MURDER. DRUNK DRIVERS SHOULD BE LABELED AS ATTEMPTED MURDERERS. SAME WITH PEOPLE WHO DRIVE AT HIGH SPEEDS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE EVADING POLICE. Liberals want to let criminals do whatever they want. I think the cops should have killed Rodney King. Rodney King killed himself. So the cops were just trying to offer him assisted suicide. Rodney King didn't care about his life when he was drunk driving at high speeds. So why should the cops care about his life too? Even worse, Rodney King could have killed an innocent bystander while drunk driving! RODNEY KING'S OWN BESTFRIEND NAMED FREDDIE HELMS DIED WHILE DRUNK DRIVING! FREDDIE HELMS WAS WITH RODNEY KING THE FIRST TIME WHEN THEY ALL GOT BEAT UP. Rodney King also robbed a store, he smashed a wooden pole at the cashier. I'm also mad at that guy John Bobbit. John Bobbit should have gotten the death penatly for what he did to Lorena Bobbit. I don't care if he is innocent. I don't care if innocent people die. Even the Innocence Project says 5% are innocent. That means 95% are guilty. Prison is barbaric. They should just give all prisoners the death penalty. I will die for my country. If I am ever wrongully accussed of a crime, I would say "I am innocent. But I am glad I got to die for my country so that humanity can stay safe!" READ HERE 99% OF RAPISTS GET AWAY WITH THEIR CRIMES. https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system So I don't care if the police kill a few "innocent" people. BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE RAPISTS OUT HERE IN THE FREE WORLD THAN THERE ARE RAPISTS IN PRISON!!</p> 
  
<p>Police Vehicular Pursuits: During 2012, there were 68,000 police vehicular pusuits, approximately 186 per day. Approximately 355 persons die each year due to police pursuits. 16.6% of fleeing drivers successfully evaded the police. 69% of police pursuits began while responding to an immediate traffic violation. Only 9% of police pursuits began while attempting to apprehend a known violent criminal.  </p> 


<p>On May, 11, 2017, Chester Bennington published two original songs. The <a href="https://youtu.be/W8tDvR_fFIc?t=216">first</a> was an amazing song with the lyrics and melody that tells how the world might end, and do not feel afraid of dying, that dying with love at heart is a dignified way to go. Chester says "I'm a lucky fellow as long you're in my bomb cellar <3." The final words of his first song was "I'm one noodle closer to death." Two months later, at July 20, 2017, Chester Bennington committed suicide by drinking alcohol and hanging himself to death. Re-examining Chester's appearance on Good Mythical Morning, his words "I'm one noodle closer to death," was a subtle confession of his plan to kill himself.</p>

<p>The brilliant Russian composer named Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, writer of "Waltz of Flowers", and "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy," he was homosexual. During 2012, a famous Russian film director named Kirill Serebrennikov, announced his plans for a documentary on the Russian composer named Tchaikovsky. The documentary would be released at 2015. Unfortunately, the documentary was never made <a href="https://www.rbth.com/arts/2013/09/24/no_russian_funds_for_tchaikovsky_biopic_amid_gay_denial_director_29609">[1]</a>. Kirill Serebrennikov was forbidden from producing the documentary because during 2013, Russia passed legislature that disallowed gay "propaganda" in media <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/11/russia-law-banning-gay-propaganda">[2]</a>. A movie about the gay Russian composer named Tchaikovsky would be too controversial. Russia's official declaration is that Tchaikovsky was NOT gay he was just lonely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/18/tchaikovsky-not-gay-russian-minister">[3]</a>. Tchaikovsky died of Cholera, but some believe the Cholera was self inflicted, in other words, Tchakovsky possibly committed suicide <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/26/arts/did-tchaikovsky-really-commit-suicide.html">[4]</a>. According to reputable historians, Tchakovsky was definitely homosexual, and Russia cencors homosexuality <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2013/08/sorry-russia-tchaikovsky-was-definitely-gay/311805/">[5]</a>.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.barstoolsports.com/podcast/1213850/butt-stuff">Call Her Daddy Podcast</a><br>The Call Her Daddy Podcast began as a podcast about sexual advice. It slowly became a podcast that chronicles the absurd lengths men go through to lie, cheat, or get laid. On episode "20 Butt Stuff" Alex tells an embarrassing poop story beginning at 32:50. Alex tells an absurd true story about lying to hide the fact she poops from her then boyfriend. Alex's story was more than simply a poop story. Pooping is the most vulnerable a human can be. Alex and Sofias' facetious life motto are "Lie until you die," "Cheat OR be cheated on," "NUDES NEVER DIE," and "If you're not sucking your man's d**k, then someone else WILL." Alex and Sofia discuss cheating, lying, manipulation, and stalking. As you listen to their podcast, you realize Alex and Sofia weren't always crazy. After years of enduring abuses by exboyfriends, Alex and Sofia became crazy. Alex and Sofia believed normal marriages was when you applied makeup, gave him unlimited sex, and tricked him into believing you are beautiful. That is why Alex had to lie that she doesn't poop, because poop is unbeautiful. Men treated women like objects, but Alex and Sofia turned the tables on men. Now men are the objects akin to trash. Secretly, Alex and Sofia just want a monogamous heterosexual relationship. But NO man is brave enough to commit to Alex or Sofia. This makes Alex and Sofia feel like nothing more than sex dolls. Alex and Sofia just want to feel beautiful, desirable, and appreciated. So the next best thing was becoming mistresses, because if a man is willing to compromise his entire marriage and family to have sex with a mistress, then this would make the mistress feel beautiful, desireable, and powerful. Secretly, Alex and Sofia are waiting for a man to cure their alcoholism and teach Alex and Sofia that healthy marriages are possible.</p>
 
 <p>On August 4, 2017 Clairo published a most amazing one hit wonder titled "Pretty Girl." During an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqzGrYnHllA">interview</a>, Clairo admitted her song titled "Bags" describes lesbian sexual apprehension. During a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8OZhv7OaqI">second</a> interview, Clairo admitted "boys" were constantly on her mind during her freshman year of college. On May 28, 2018 Clairo tweeted "B.O.M.D. is also G.O.M.D. for ur information" and "was wondering how to ever say this publicly LOL." A twitter user commented "wait is this a coming out tweet?" and Clairo replied "Yes." This was Clairo's first-time public official confirmation that Clairo is bisexual. "B.O.M.D" OR "G.O.M.D" means "BOY/GIRL of My Dreams," referring to Clairo's song titled "B.O.M.D." I really enjoyed Clairo's "Pretty Girl," because it encapsulates an ambiguous melancholic mood. Clairo was accused of plagiarizing Charlotte. Clairo is also criticized because Clairo's father is a wealthy marketing bussiness person named Geoff Cottrill. Liberals hate rich people. Liberals hate Clairo, because liberals think Clairo portrays herself as a self made indie artist, when supposedly her dad's money = white privilege. Stupid organic hipster tree hugging liberals are bullying Clairo by calling her an "Industry Plant," conspiracy theorizing that all her songs and style was a careful marketing decision by some wealthy Jews. These liberals are so stupid, they don't realize they are bullying an actual LGBTQ person named Clairo. Don't believe me? Then check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9suMaGOnXNk">this</a> person's video.</p>
 
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qggoumYi0">Life is Beautiful</a><br>What I loved about this film was the character development for Guido Orefice. Guido Orefice did everything within his power, to bring joy and happiness towards the only two persons he was responsible for, his wife and child. Guido Orefice did all this while living in a cruel disgusting reality called Earth. The movie is titled "Life is Beautiful," but I believe the title was the directors' sneery way of saying "Life is Ugly," because that is how I felt after watching Guido Orefice die.<br>My second favorite scene of the film was when a woman at dinner says "We don't feed stray squirrels. Why? Because if you feed a stray squirrel, then it produces offspring, then you have a FAMILY of stray squirrels. For the same reason, we don't feed homeless humans. We let them die the same we let squirrels die."</p>
