 <p>I swear to fucking God. About 3-5 years ago. I was at Taco Bell near my house. All the employee were African-American. All of them.</p>
 <p>I ordered some tacos. Man they took a long time! I was sitting there waiting. And the whole time all the African-American employees were talking and laughing. I sweat to God. I was the only customer. And one African-American man said "She was so hot. I needed to fuck. She made me wait 2 whole damn years for sex. But damn she was hot. So I waited and waited. I didn't have sex for 2 years. And then boom. She let me fuck her pussy. The next day I cheated on her. I didn't give a fuck. It was worth it. She was hot. I mean damn. she was hot asf like damn."
