 <p>I am beginning to fear the state of our country. I fear one day rioters will take control of a police dispatch precinct. Rioters will break into my home at night holding me at gun point. I will dial the police. The 911 emergency number would respond "This system is unavailable."</p>
 
 <p>Imagine a world without police. What would you do knowing you could get away with any crime just for one night. What would your neighbors do?</p>
