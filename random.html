<h1>Random</h1>
 
 <p>2019. My friend had a graduation celebration. The party event occured in my mom's house backyard. During the party, I spoke to my sister after so many years of never talking to her. I had only heard bad things about my sister and her boyfriend. I heard my sister and her boyfriend are illegally breeding purbred french bulldogs to sell them for $7,000 each. </p>
 
 <h1>My Biological Sister's First Dog</h1>
<p>My biological sister's first dog. It was a long time ago ~2005. The dog got his head stuck underneath a fence. The adults had to remove the fence to help release the dog. My biological father would always carry the dog by <a href="https://cdn.omlet.co.uk/images/originals/Dog-Dog_Guide-How_to_pick_up_a_puppy_by_the_scruff.jpg">pinching</a> the dog's loose skin-folds. I asked my father "Dad why do we carry dogs by it's loose skin-folds?" My father replied "My friend is a dog breeder. It doesn't harm dogs. This is how dog's carry their offspring, by holding it on their scruffs. It teaches dogs how to respect humans." I replied "Would you atleast carry him with two of your hands?" My father replied "No. Dog's don't feel on their <a href="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/puppy-picked-up-scruff-neck-isolated-white-background-94959908.jpg">scruffs</a>." </p>
 
<h1>My Biological Father's Dogfighting Bloodsport</h1>
<p>I learned that my biological father had so many opinions about dogs, because he used to charge people to come watch his dogs fight eachother. I asked my biological father "Is it true that you used to host dogfighting events?" My biological father replied "Yes. I was young and naive. I did what I had to do to earn money. But I regret it making dogs fight. I don't condone it anymore." I asked my biological father "Would the dogs fight to their deaths?" My biological father replied "Without human intervention, the dogs could kill eachother. But I never allowed it. The dogs would fight until they were bloody.</p> 
 
 the My sister's friend said "Hello, do you want a dog? I have a dog. I don't want it anymore."
 
 One of my sister's dogs ranaway, got ran over by a car and died. Another of my sister's french bulldog named Ada would runaway every few weeks, but was always at a neighbor's house, Ada was missing for 6-12 hours each time; but one day Ada ran away for multiple days, so my sister put up 'wanted' signs, and someone returned the dog to my sister; the same dog ranaway again, was gone multiple days, a stranger returned the dog and said "We found this homeless dog. We impregnanted her. We planned to sell the puppies. But when we saw the 'wanted' signs, we felt sorry that we took this dog away from a loving family. So we brought her back to you. Your dog is pregnant. Here you go." The dog gave birth and my sister's boyfriend sold the puppies for thousands of dollars each. My sister kept one dog named</p>
