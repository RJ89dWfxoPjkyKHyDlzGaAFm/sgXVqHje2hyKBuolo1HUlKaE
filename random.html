<h1>Random</h1>
 
<p>2019. My friend had a graduation celebration. The party event occured in my mom's house backyard. During the party, I spoke to my sister after so many years of never talking to her. I had only heard bad things about my sister and her boyfriend. I heard my sister and her boyfriend are illegally breeding purbred french bulldogs to sell them for $7,000 each. My sister's instagram is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/frenchfriesfrenchdogs/">@frenchfriesfrenchdogs</a> . I reported my sister to the Animal Control. Nothing happened.</p>
 
 <h1>My Biological Sister's First Dog</h1>
<p>My biological sister's first dog. It was a long time ago ~2005. The dog got his head stuck underneath a fence. The adults had to remove the fence to help release the dog. My biological father would always carry the dog by <a href="https://cdn.omlet.co.uk/images/originals/Dog-Dog_Guide-How_to_pick_up_a_puppy_by_the_scruff.jpg">pinching</a> the dog's loose skin-folds. I asked my father "Dad why do we carry dogs by its loose skin-folds?" My father replied "My friend is a dog breeder. It doesn't harm dogs. This is how dog's carry their offspring, by holding it on their scruffs. It teaches dogs how to respect humans." I replied "Would you atleast carry him with two of your hands?" My father replied "No. Dog's don't feel on their <a href="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/puppy-picked-up-scruff-neck-isolated-white-background-94959908.jpg">scruffs</a>." </p>
 
<h1>My Biological Father's Dogfighting Bloodsport</h1>
<p>I asked my biological father "Is it true that you hosted dogfighting events?" My biological father replied "Yes. I was young and naive. I did what I had to do to earn money. I regret allowing the dogs to fight eachother. I don't condone it anymore." I asked my biological father "Would the dogs fight to their deaths?" My biological father replied "No. I never allowed the dogs to die. The dogs would fight until they were bloody. Some dogs gave up, or the dog owners forfeited, or the judges concluded. But it was never deathly. I never made the dogs fight. Others brought their own dog. I simply hosted the events at my house. I charged a $100 entrance fee per spectator. That was how I earned money. If the cops showed up, I would have been the first one to get arrested because it was my house. Well actually it was your biological mother's house, but the cops never showed up."</p> 
 
 <h1>My Biological Sister's Second Dog</h1>
<p>~2016 My biological sister's friend said "Hello, do you want a dog? I have a dog. I don't want it anymore. If you don't take it. I will probably just send it to a shelter or something." My biological sister replied "Okay. I'll take your dog. This dog will teach my [biological] sons how to become responsible adults. My sons will sweep the dog poop everyday." My sister became the new owner of this dog. Several months later, that dog ranaway, got ran over by a car and died.</p>
 
 <h1>My Biological Sister's Third and Fourth dogs (Ada + Bruce)</h1>
  
<p>On June 11, 2017 my sister purchased a French Bulldog that was named 'Ada'. Every few weeks, Ada ranaway and went missing for 6-12 hours, but was recovered at a neighbor's house. I said to my sister "If Ada keeps running away, that means you need to spay her to control her hormones. My sister replied "No. We are going to breed Ada to sell the offspring at $7,000 per puppy."</p>
 
 <p>Another instance, Ada ranaway and went missing for 1-2 weeks, my sister put up 'wanted' signs everywhere, but a person returned Ada to my sister. I asked my sister and her boyfriend "How did Ada escape?" My sister replied "My boyfriend's [biological] father is moving into the backhouse. He left the gate opened." My sister's boyfriend replied "Ada only ranaway one time. All the other times, Ada was just chilling at our neighbor's house. I think our neighbor is giving Ada hotdogs or something haha."<p>
 
 <p>Another instance, Ada ranaway and went missing for 3-4 weeks, but a stranger returned Ada to my sister and said "We found this homeless French Bull dog. We impregnanted her with another French Bulldog. We planned to sell the puppies. But when we saw the 'wanted' signs, we felt sorry that we took this dog away from a loving family. So we brought her back to you. Your dog is pregnant now. Here you go." Ada gave birth and my sister sold the puppies for thousands of dollars each. My sister and her boyfriend kept one puppy named Bruce, but they refused to neuter Bruce. My sister said "We are not going to take away Bruce's manhood. We are not going to pay for that unnecessary surgical process. If you want to neuter Bruce, go ahead, with your own money."</p> 
 
 <h1>My Biological Sister's Weightloss Journey</h1>
 <p>Every few weeks, my sister says "I am on a keto diet," or "I am on a paleo diet," or "I am juice-cleansing." One day my sister said "I am going to this really fancy expensive gym. It cost a lot of money. BUT if you lose weight, by the end of your membership, the gym will repay you, so it's free." My sister paid $1,000 for a microwave machine that eliminates excess fat on the body (scam), she purchased it from her OBESE friend! My sister paid $60 for some mexican pills called 'Alipotec (Tejocote Root)' supposed to help you lose weight, and my sister said "I just kept on peeing and peeing all day. I was peeing a lot." My sister purchased these $60 pills called 'Alli (Orlistat),' and said "I ate a greasy pizza. Several hours later. My butt was wet. I thought I peed myself. I went to the bathroom. It turns out my butthole was leaking the oil from the pizza I ate."  </p>
 
 <h1>My Biological Sister's Alcoholism Journey</h1>
 <p>A doctor told my sister that her liver was diseased. My sister said "I am not drinking alcohol anymore." My sister ranover a fire-hydrant with her car while driving during a hangover, my sister said "I am not drinking alcohol anymore." My sister needed help installing Microsoft Office on her laptop. I went to her house, and my sister and her boyfriend were just drinking beer all day and arguing, my sister said to her boyfriend "You signed up for a free-trial of HBO and Hulu, you said you were going to cancel the free-trials, but they have overcharged us all these months!" My sister's boyfriend replied "Relax. It's not a big deal. You're the one who uses these services the most." My sister said "I only watch Netflix and Amazon."</p>
 
 <p>A few weeks later, I saw my biological sister and her boyfriend at a family party. My sister was drinking beer and said "I got my gallblader and appendix surgically removed." My sister's boyfriend said "I know this guy that hacks internet modems. Normally internet costs $70. But I have free unlimited internet because of this guy I know. You just pay him $250. It's been years that we've had free unlimited internet. My other friend hacks Amazon Fire TV Sticks, he put Popcorn Time on my computer. But we got a letter from the ISP that we need to stop watching illegal movies online or else they will cancel our internet, we got the same warning 2 times already."</p> 
 
 <p>I said "Are you addicted to alcohol?" My sister said "No." My sister's boyfriend said "Nah. It's just that everytime you see us, you only see us during holidays and parties such as today." I said "What about a few weeks ago, I saw you drinking beer at your house." My sister's boyfriend replied "That was just one time. It was during a Sunday afternoon."<p>
 
 <p>A few weeks later, I went to my sister's house to install Ikea furniture. My sister and her boyfriend were both drinking beer with a bunch of friends not celebrating anything. There was an obese woman who never moved from her chair. The obese woman was always sitting down, only her lips moved. And all day long she was talking "Monica, is dating this guy Julio. Julio has no job. He even says he doesn't need a job. He just lives with his parents and drinks beer." My sister said "But Monica, is so beautiful why would she?" Then the obese woman whispered "Monica got drunk at Las Vegas, and said she only stays with Julio because he is great at eating pussy."</p>
