 <p><a href="https://www.barstoolsports.com/podcast/1213850/butt-stuff">Call Her Daddy Podcast</a><br>The Call Her Daddy Podcast began as a podcast about sexual advice. It slowly became a podcast that chronicles the absurd lengths men go through to lie, cheat, or get laid. On episode "20 Butt Stuff" Alex tells an embarrassing poop story beginning at 32:50. Alex tells an absurd true story about lying to hide the fact she poops from her then boyfriend. Alex's story was more than simply a poop story. Pooping is the most vulnerable a human can be. Alex and Sofias' facetious life motto are "Lie until you die," "Cheat OR be cheated on," "NUDES NEVER DIE," and "If you're not sucking your man's d**k, then someone else WILL." Alex and Sofia discuss cheating, lying, manipulation, and stalking. As you listen to their podcast, you realize Alex and Sofia weren't always crazy. After years of enduring abuses by exboyfriends, Alex and Sofia became crazy. Alex and Sofia believed normal marriages was when you applied makeup, gave him unlimited sex, and tricked him into believing you are beautiful. That is why Alex had to lie that she doesn't poop, because poop is unbeautiful. Men treated women like objects, but Alex and Sofia turned the tables on men. Now men are the objects akin to trash. Secretly, Alex and Sofia just want a monogamous heterosexual relationship. But NO man is brave enough to commit to Alex or Sofia. This makes Alex and Sofia feel like nothing more than sex dolls. Alex and Sofia just want to feel beautiful, desirable, and appreciated. So the next best thing was becoming mistresses, because if a man is willing to compromise his entire marriage and family to have sex with a mistress, then this would make the mistress feel beautiful, desireable, and powerful. Secretly, Alex and Sofia are waiting for a man to cure their alcoholism and teach Alex and Sofia that healthy marriages are possible. Don't believe me?

 <p>On August 4, 2017 Clairo published a most amazing one hit wonder titled "Pretty Girl." During an interview, Clairo admitted her song titled "Bags" tells the story of a lesbian woman encountering anxiety during her first lesbian sexual encounter. During another interview, Clairo admitted "boys" were constantly on her mind during her freshman year of college. On May 28, 2018 Clairo tweeted "B.O.M.D. is also G.O.M.D. for ur information" and "was wondering how to ever say this publicly LOL." A twitter user commented "wait is this a coming out tweet?" and Clairo replied "Yes." This was Clairo's first-time public official confirmation that Clairo is bisexual. "B.O.M.D" OR "G.O.M.D" means "BOY/GIRL of My Dreams," referring to Clairo's song titled "B.O.M.D." I really enjoyed Clairo's "Pretty Girl," because it encapsulates an ambiguous melancholic mood. Clairo was accused of plagiarizing Charlotte. Clairo is also criticized because Clairo's father is a wealthy marketing bussiness person named Geoff Cottrill. Liberals hate rich people. Liberals hate Clairo, because liberals think Clairo portrays herself as a self made indie artist, when supposedly her dad's money = white privilege. Stupid organic hipster tree hugging liberals are bullying Clairo by calling her an "Industry Plant," conspiracy theorizing that all her songs and style was a careful marketing decision by some wealthy Jews. These liberals are so stupid, they don't realize they are bullying an actual LGBTQ person named Clairo.</p>
 
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qggoumYi0">Life is Beautiful</a><br>My 5th grade teacher showed me this film. I remember when my 5th grade teacher said "Nazis killed anyone who had neither blonde hair nor blue eyes," I thought to myself "That is a stupid reason to go to war." Then, I grew up studying World War 2. Everything about the Third Reich ideology was correct, and makes perfect sense to me. I agree with everything the Third Reich believed, EXCEPT for the part when they began killing people. Same with incels, I agree with everything incels believe, EXCEPT for the pary when they started killing people. I wish to one day see an avant garde movie that portrays the Third Reich as the noble war heros who lost.<br>What I loved about this film was the character development for Guido Orefice. Guido Orefice did everything within his power, to bring joy and happiness towards the only two persons he was responsible for, his wife and child. Guido Orefice did all this while living in a cruel disgusting reality called Earth. The movie is titled "Life is Beautiful," but I believe the title was the directors' sneery way of saying "Life is Ugly," because that is how I felt after watching Guido Orefice die.<br>My second favorite scene of the film was when a woman at dinner says "The burden of society are those feeble minded and sick. By killing feeble and sick, we would remove their disease from our aryan genetics, thus reduce the plight deviants have to our crippled economy. For every 1 disabled person in hospital, it requires 4 or 5 healthy persons to pay enough taxes to keep a disabled person alive in hospital. We don't feed stray squirrels. Why? Because if you feed a stray squirrel, then it produces offspring, then you have a FAMILY of stray squirrels. For the same reason, we don't feed homeless humans. We let them die the same we let squirrels die."</p>
