<h1>Random</h1>
 
 <p>2019. My friend had a graduation celebration. The party event occured in my mom's house backyard. During the party, I spoke to my sister after so many years of never talking to her. I had only heard bad things about my sister and her boyfriend. I heard my sister and her boyfriend are illegally breeding purbred french bulldogs to sell them for $7,000 each. My sister's instagram is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/frenchfriesfrenchdogs/">@frenchfriesfrenchdogs</a> . I reported my sister to the Animal Control. Nothing happened.</p>
 
 <h1>My Biological Sister's First Dog</h1>
<p>My biological sister's first dog. It was a long time ago ~2005. The dog got his head stuck underneath a fence. The adults had to remove the fence to help release the dog. My biological father would always carry the dog by <a href="https://cdn.omlet.co.uk/images/originals/Dog-Dog_Guide-How_to_pick_up_a_puppy_by_the_scruff.jpg">pinching</a> the dog's loose skin-folds. I asked my father "Dad why do we carry dogs by it's loose skin-folds?" My father replied "My friend is a dog breeder. It doesn't harm dogs. This is how dog's carry their offspring, by holding it on their scruffs. It teaches dogs how to respect humans." I replied "Would you atleast carry him with two of your hands?" My father replied "No. Dog's don't feel on their <a href="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/puppy-picked-up-scruff-neck-isolated-white-background-94959908.jpg">scruffs</a>." </p>
 
<h1>My Biological Father's Dogfighting Bloodsport</h1>
<p>I asked my biological father "Is it true that you used to host dogfighting events?" My biological father replied "Yes. I was young and naive. I did what I had to do to earn money. I regret allowing the dogs to fight eachother. I don't condone it anymore." I asked my biological father "Would the dogs fight to their deaths?" My biological father replied "No. I never allowed the dogs to die. The dogs would fight until they were bloody. Some dogs gave up, or the dog owners forfeited, or the judges concluded. But it was never deathly. The dogs were a financial investment. We made gambling wagers. Some dogs gave up, or the dog owners forfeited, or the judges concluded. But it was never deathly. I never made my own dogs fight. Others brought their own dog. I simply hosted the events at my house. I charged a $100 entrance fee per spectator. That was how I earned money. If the cops showed up, I would have been the first one to get arrested because it was my house. Well actually it was your biological mother's house, but the cops never showed up."</p> 
 
 <h1>My Biological Sister's Second Dog</h1>
<p>~2016 My biological sister's friend said "Hello, do you want a dog? I have a dog. I don't want it anymore. If you don't take it. I will probably just send it to a shelter or something." My biological sister replied "Okay. I'll take your dog. My biological sons will sweep the dog poop everyday. They will learn how to become responsible adults." My sister became the new owner of this dog. Several months later, that dog ranaway, got ran over by a car and died.</p>
 
 <h1>My Biological Sister's Third Dog</h1>
  
<p>My sister's french bulldog was named Ada. Every few weeks, Ada runaway and went missing for 6-12 hours, but was found again at a neighbor's house. Another instance, Ada runaway and went missing for 1-2 weeks, my sister put up 'wanted' signs everywhere, but someone returned Ada to my sister. I said to my sister "If Ada keeps running away, that means you need to spay her to control her hormones. My sister replied "No. We are going to breed Ada to sell the offspring at $7,000 per puppy." I asked my sister and her boyfriend "How did Ada escape?" My sister replied "My boyfriend's dad is moving to the backhouse. He left the gate opened." My sister's boyfriend replied "This was the first time Ada ran away. All the other times, Ada was just chilling at our neighbor's house. I think the neighbor is giving Ada hotdogs or something haha."<p>
 
 <p>Another instance, Ada runaway and went missing for 3-4 weeks, but a stranger returned the dog to my sister and said "We found this homeless dog. We impregnanted her. We planned to sell the puppies. But when we saw the 'wanted' signs, we felt sorry that we took this dog away from a loving family. So we brought her back to you. Your dog is pregnant now. Here you go." The dog gave birth and my sister's boyfriend sold the puppies for thousands of dollars each. My sister and her boyfriend kept one dog named Bruce, but they refuse to neuter Bruce because they don't want to 'take away his manhood' and 'I'm not going to pay for that unnecessary surgical process. If you want to neuter Bruce, go ahead, with your own money.'</p>
