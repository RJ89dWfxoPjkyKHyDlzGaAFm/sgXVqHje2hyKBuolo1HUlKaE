<p>Here is a video about a white guy who accidentally killed someone while drunk driving, he ran them over. He went to prison. Because he was small skinny and white. A bunch of black dudes hardcore raped him until his butthole was bleeding they laughed at his face. He got HIV from it. Now he is going to die <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1knkqH4Vi8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1knkqH4Vi8</a>. What's worse? Being raped by a bunch of black dudes till you got HIV? or dying from a knee on your neck?</p> 
 
 <p>Noone reads my website. But anyways. A long time ago I told you guys about how I fixed a mexican's computer and found a video of him at his job forcing a pitbull dog to drink beer with a car funnel. (I don't have a computer fixing business, I was not charging money, I was just doing him a favor.) And anyways here is a screenshot of the stupid mexicans. I hate mexicans. I hate blacks. I don't care. I'm chicano. Fuck you, if you believe in Black Lives Matter. You are all stupid. You live in a bubble. So then I was young when I found this video. I asked my dad what should I do, and he said "Oh haha me and my brothers did that to a dog in mexico LOL some dogs like to drink beer." I hate colored people.</p>
