 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qggoumYi0">Life is Beautiful</a><br> My favorite movie. This film contains an obvious liberal agenda to portray the Third Reich as purely evil doers, and Jews as purely innocent victims. My 5th grade teacher showed me this film. I remember when my 5th grade teacher said "Nazis killed anyone who had neither blonde hair nor blue eyes," I thought to myself "That is a stupid reason to go to war." Then, I grew up studying World War 2. I realized everything Nazis did makes perfect sense.<br> I wish to one day see a movie that portrays the Third Reich as the heros who lost, but liberal media would not allow it. What I loved about this film was the character development for Guido Orefice. Guido Orefice did everything within his power, to bring joy and happiness towards the only two persons he was responsible for, his wife and child. Guido Orefice did all this while living in a cruel disgusting reality called Earth. The movie is titled "Life is Beautiful," but I believe the title was the directors' sneery way of saying "Life is Ugly," because that is how I felt after watching Guido Orefice die.<br>My second favorite scene of the film was when a woman at dinner says "The burden of society are those feeble minded and sick. By killing feeble and sick, we would remove their disease from our aryan genetics, thus reduce the plight deviants have to our crippled economy. For every 1 disabled person in hospital, it requires 4 or 5 healthy persons to pay enough taxes to keep a disabled person alive in hospital. We don't feed stray squirrels. Why? Because if you feed a stray squirrel, then it produces offspring, then you have a FAMILY of stray squirrels. For the same reason, we don't feed homeless humans."</p>
