 <p>Wait here.</p>
 <p>I read a book titled "Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg." It said if you want to stop protesters, you have to arrest people who are selling food and water, so they will feel thirsty and leave. I saw on twitter people are giving food and water to protesters.</p>
 
 <p>So they can call cops 'pigs,' but we cannot call blacks 'monkeys.' Black Lives Matter people are so stupid. The taxonmoic pig species are beautiful animals. But apparently the taxonmic pig species are lesser than humans.</p>
 
 <p>Oh no guys! dude! NOOO!!! I can't find it. OMG We are being oppressed. They deleted the racist website. I was going to show you guys. It was a webist called niggermania.com. It had a bunch of racist facts. It was crazy! Like woah dude. I am really scared. They truth is being supressed. You know we are all being supressed. I am not allowed to talk about racist things or else I will get deleted. I've been thinking about this whole racist stuff for a long time now. But I don't know how to tell people. People are stupid.<p>
