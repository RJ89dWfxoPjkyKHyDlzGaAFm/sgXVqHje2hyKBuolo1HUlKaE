 <p>April 29, 2020. Today is not a good day for me. Sorry I havent written much here. I am dealing with some problems. I have a few ideas,</p>

<p>The brilliant Russian composer named Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, writer of "Waltz of Flowers", and "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy," he was homosexual. During 2012, a famous Russian film director named Kirill Serebrennikov, announced his plans for a documentary on the Russian composer named Tchaikovsky. The documentary would be released at 2015. Unfortunately, the documentary was never made <a href="https://www.rbth.com/arts/2013/09/24/no_russian_funds_for_tchaikovsky_biopic_amid_gay_denial_director_29609">[1]</a>. Kirill Serebrennikov was forbidden from producing the documentary because during 2013, Russia passed legislature that disallowed gay "propaganda" in media <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/11/russia-law-banning-gay-propaganda">[2]</a>. A movie about the gay Russian composer named Tchaikovsky would be too controversial. Russia's official declaration is that Tchaikovsky was NOT gay he was just lonely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/18/tchaikovsky-not-gay-russian-minister">[3]</a>. Tchaikovsky died of Cholera, but some believe the Cholera was self inflicted, in other words, Tchakovsky possibly committed suicide <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/26/arts/did-tchaikovsky-really-commit-suicide.html">[4]</a>. According to reputable historians, Tchakovsky was definitely homosexual, and Russia cencors homosexuality <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2013/08/sorry-russia-tchaikovsky-was-definitely-gay/311805/">[5]</a> . Historians know from reading all of Tchaikovsky's love letters about men.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.barstoolsports.com/podcast/1213850/butt-stuff">Call Her Daddy Podcast</a><br>The Call Her Daddy Podcast began as a podcast about sexual advice. It slowly became a podcast that chronicles the absurd lengths men go through to lie, cheat, or get laid. On episode "20 Butt Stuff" Alex tells an embarrassing poop story beginning at 32:50. Alex tells an absurd true story about lying to hide the fact she poops from her then boyfriend. Alex's story was more than simply a poop story. Pooping is the most vulnerable a human can be. Alex and Sofias' facetious life motto are "Lie until you die," "Cheat OR be cheated on," "NUDES NEVER DIE," and "If you're not sucking your man's d**k, then someone else WILL." Alex and Sofia discuss cheating, lying, manipulation, and stalking. As you listen to their podcast, you realize Alex and Sofia weren't always crazy. After years of enduring abuses by exboyfriends, Alex and Sofia became crazy. Alex and Sofia believed normal marriages was when you applied makeup, gave him unlimited sex, and tricked him into believing you are beautiful. That is why Alex had to lie that she doesn't poop, because poop is unbeautiful. Men treated women like objects, but Alex and Sofia turned the tables on men. Now men are the objects akin to trash. Secretly, Alex and Sofia just want a monogamous heterosexual relationship. But NO man is brave enough to commit to Alex or Sofia. This makes Alex and Sofia feel like nothing more than sex dolls. Alex and Sofia just want to feel beautiful, desirable, and appreciated. So the next best thing was becoming mistresses, because if a man is willing to compromise his entire marriage and family to have sex with a mistress, then this would make the mistress feel beautiful, desireable, and powerful. Secretly, Alex and Sofia are waiting for a man to cure their alcoholism and teach Alex and Sofia that healthy marriages are possible.</p>
 
 <p>On August 4, 2017 Clairo published a most amazing one hit wonder titled "Pretty Girl." During an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqzGrYnHllA">interview</a>, Clairo admitted her song titled "Bags" describes lesbian sexual apprehension. During a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8OZhv7OaqI">second</a> interview, Clairo admitted "boys" were constantly on her mind during her freshman year of college. On May 28, 2018 Clairo tweeted "B.O.M.D. is also G.O.M.D. for ur information" and "was wondering how to ever say this publicly LOL." A twitter user commented "wait is this a coming out tweet?" and Clairo replied "Yes." This was Clairo's first-time public official confirmation that Clairo is bisexual. "B.O.M.D" OR "G.O.M.D" means "BOY/GIRL of My Dreams," referring to Clairo's song titled "B.O.M.D." I really enjoyed Clairo's "Pretty Girl," because it encapsulates an ambiguous melancholic mood. Clairo was accused of plagiarizing Charlotte. Clairo is also criticized because Clairo's father is a wealthy marketing bussiness person named Geoff Cottrill. Liberals hate rich people. Liberals hate Clairo, because liberals think Clairo portrays herself as a self made indie artist, when supposedly her dad's money = white privilege. Stupid organic hipster tree hugging liberals are bullying Clairo by calling her an "Industry Plant," conspiracy theorizing that all her songs and style was a careful marketing decision by some wealthy Jews. These liberals are so stupid, they don't realize they are bullying an actual LGBTQ person named Clairo. Don't believe me? Then check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9suMaGOnXNk">this</a> person's video.</p>
 
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qggoumYi0">Life is Beautiful</a><br>What I loved about this film was the character development for Guido Orefice. Guido Orefice did everything within his power, to bring joy and happiness towards the only two persons he was responsible for, his wife and child. Guido Orefice did all this while living in a cruel disgusting reality called Earth. The movie is titled "Life is Beautiful," but I believe the title was the directors' sneery way of saying "Life is Ugly," because that is how I felt after watching Guido Orefice die.<br>My second favorite scene of the film was when a woman at dinner says "We don't feed stray squirrels. Why? Because if you feed a stray squirrel, then it produces offspring, then you have a FAMILY of stray squirrels. For the same reason, we don't feed homeless humans. We let them die the same we let squirrels die."</p>
