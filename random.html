<p>Do these people even know the shoes they are looting are manufactured by actual slaves in 3rd world countries. They worship shoes made by slaves.</p>
 <p>You are on the wrong side of the war. All the nonwhite Black Lives Matter people abuse animals, abuse their children, and abuse their wives. I know it. I am chicano. I see it everyday. My mexican father abandoned me. My mexican father never paid child support money, but he drives expensive cars. One day my mexican father took my young sister to a mexican man named Salatiel. The mexican man named Salatiel sexually abused my mexican sister.</p>
  
<p>My mexican mother believes in witchcraft. My mexican mother committed infidelity on my father believing that her dreams predicted the future. My mexican mother raised me. She gave me food, water, and shelter. But she never warned me about the dangers of drugs. My mexican mother never talked me. My mexican mother never taught me any life lessons. I was expected to learn about the world all alone. Whenever I asked my mother a question, she would only yell at me. One day my teacher gave me a homework assignment to discuss a questionnaire with my parent. The first question was "What is your ethnicity?" I asked my mother "what does ethnicity mean?" and my mother replied "Mexican." I replied "How do you know if I'm mexican? Was I born in Mexico?" My mother replied "I don't know! Leave me the fuck alone! Can't you see! I'm busy! I have to work!" I ripped my homework crying to my mother "I am never going to do my homework ever again!" My mother replied "I don't care." So I never did a homework assignment ever again and I didn't finish high school. It was too late when I realized I misbehaved in order to spite my mother because of a grudge I held onto from childhood.</p>
 
<p>One day I said "Please mommy let's do a puzzle?" My mother said "Not now. I have to work. Tomorrow we'll do a puzzle." She kissed me on my cheek saying goodbye and left to work. The next day I said "Mommy can we do a coloring book today?" My mother raised a white porcelain cup at me and yelled at me "Shut up! Leave me alone! I'm going to kill you!"</p>
 
<p>Every single mexican person in my family, every last one us, was an unplanned pregnancy. My grandmother even drank alcohol during some pregnancies.<p>
 
 <p>But I don't blame white people for any of our mexican problems. I blame mexicans. One day I went on the internet and discovered Stuff You Should Know and Good Mythical Morning. I realized there was always white people trying to help me. A white man taught me how to play a recorder in school. A white woman taught me how to play a harp. A white man wanted to give me a $120,000 scholarship. A white teacher asked me "How are things at home?" a white social worker asked me "Do you know who Salatiel is?" Whites invented everything. But all I see is very bad people who hate cops. Even when I was homeless, a mexican man said to me "Where you from homie? Show me your tattoos. I stayed all night smoking meth and watch you sleep in your blue sleeping bag. Yeah, I know your sleeping bag is blue. I know where you sleep. You will know better than sleeping in a bag like that. I'm going to stab you in your sleeping bag and stick my dick inside your asshole." His mexican friends laughed at me. One mexican laughed at my skinny jeans and called me gay. The only reason I was talking to them was because I was talking to the whitest mexican in the group. They called him "guerito" which means white-skinned. Guerito was half white and half mexican. Guerito was sort of nice to me. We had good conversations. Guerito said "Ah, don't listen to him. He is just sizing you up homie. He is testing you to see how tough are you. That means he likes you. You need a mentor if you want to stay with us. I was just like you when I was young. These guys took me in when noone else wanted me. They showed me la famalia."</p>
 
 <p>So I talked to Guerito a bit. He told me his friends killed a couple people. I stopped talk to them because they were all literally gangmembers. So I didn't feel bad when the mexican threatened to rape me. He was testing me. He didn't seem serious. It hurts me more what the blacks did to me. I was homeless with only a bicylce which I had chained up near me. I saw two suspicious black persons standing 50 yards away from my bike. I wasn't thinking about my bike. I was thinking if they were going to rape me or something. So I went up to them in order to assess the situation and I said "Hey, if you're going to do drugs here that's fine. My name is Jovanny. Nice to meet you." And the two black people didn't even acknowledge me. They ignored me. I saw one guy was wearing a large overcoat. He suspiciously walked slowly away, but never acknowledge me. The next day I noticed my bike-lock had deep cuts on it. That was when I realized these two blacks tried to steal my bike! He had a giant bolt cutter underneath his overcoat! I felt angry! I worked hard for that bike! I realized the reason the blacks never looked me in my eyes, the reason they never acknowledged me, is because they saw me as lesser than a human because I was homeless. They basically said to themselves about me "This guy is a homeless crackhead. Don't talk to him."</p>
 
<p>There is a homeless schitzophrenic woman outside my neighborhood. She is always talking to herself. My street friends told me "Some mexican gangmembers did a bunch of drugs and went to the homeless woman. They laughed at her. One of them took his gun and smacked the homeless girl with it. The other mexican gangmember said to the homeless woman "Shut the fuck up bitch. Who are you talking to? Haha. Stop being homeless, get a fucking job. I'll give you a job right now. Suck my dick."</p>
 
<p>Everywhere I go I see mexicans being mean to homeless people and mentally ill people. Mexicans are always judging me based on the clothes I wear and how I talk. They ignore me. They treat me like I am lesser than human.</p>
 
 <p>Anyways I was homeless. A mexican threated to rape me. It didn't bother me. But when a group of black men all threatened to beat me up, I actually cried. The tone of their voice. They were all crazy. Like they were not kidding. I called the cops on them. I was crying. The cops showed and yelled at me. But I didn't care. Literally the cops did police brutality on me. The cop threatened to kill me. But I didn't fucking care. I told the cop "A man accused me of trying to steal from his car. He grabbed me and they all told me they were going to kill me." The cop didn't take me seriously because I had mental illness. The cop said "I command you to leave! That's an order! Leave or I am going to arrest you! Leave! You're not all there. Look at you. You look stupid! If I saw you standing next to my car. I would too. I would grab my gun and shoot you on your fucking head!" I did not give a shit. I was not offended at all. In fact I was relieved they put a tough guy like him to protect people. I knew he wasn't gonna hurt me. All I had to do was obey his orders so I did. I didn't tell the cop the people who threatened me were black. Then the black guy showed up and I pointed at the black guy, I said "That's the guy over there who threatened me." The cop turned around and the look on his face changed. All of a sudden it was like he said to himself "Oh. I get it now. It's niggers." Then his partner said in a sweet voice "Go kid. We'll take it from here." It was like good cop bad cop.</p> 
 
 <p>I'v been racially profiled. I don't give a shit. Cops are just doing their damn jobs. As long you follow their orders nothing happens! But so many colored people get angry and emotional! They won't sit still. That's why they get shot. </p>
 
 <p>This white drug dealer told me "I don't do business with blacks. Blacks are always try to buy drugs with counterfeit money." 
</p>
 
 anyways here a video about a white guy who accidentally killed someone while drunk driving, he ran them over. He went to prison. Because he was small skinny and white. A bunch of black dudes hardcore raped him until his butthole was bleeding they laughed at his face. He got HIV from it. Now he is going to die <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1knkqH4Vi8"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1knkqH4Vi8</a>.</p>
