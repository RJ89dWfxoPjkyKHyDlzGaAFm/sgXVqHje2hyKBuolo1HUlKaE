 <p>I swear to fucking God. About 3-5 years ago. I was at Taco Bell near my house. All the employee were African-American. All of them.</p>
 <p>I ordered some tacos. Man they took a long time! I was sitting there waiting. All the whole time, the African-American employees were talking and laughing. I swear to God. I was the only customer. The African-American man said "She was so bomb. I needed to fuck. She made me wait 2 whole damn years for sex. But damn she was hot. She was hot like damn. So I waited and waited. I didn't have sex for 2 years. And then boom. She let me fuck her pussy. The next day I cheated on her." 
  
 <p>Then all the African-American employees laughed so hard. They were like "Nah. Nah. Bruh!"</p>
 <p>I'm telling you Black Men ain't shit! Black Lives Matter people are so stupid! I mean what the fuck! Do you actually need school to teach you to do not kill rape and burglarize?? These black people are not stealing food! They are stealing shoes and macbooks! They don't need any of those things!</p>
 
<p>So guess what. On year later, the Taco Bell went out of business. Now it's a Starbucks Coffee. But all the employees are still African-American. They take forever. Sometimes they give your order wrong. But they always hum and dance a little while they are brewing your hot coffee.</p>
 
 <p>Black Lives Matter people are so stupid. Like what the fuck! They actually think they built this country. You know the middle east terrorists invented slavery. They tried to build an empire from slavery but failed cause they are stupid. And what the fuck did the blacks give us? Cloth? cotton? That shit doesn't exist anymore! Everything blacks 'built' for this country is in a landfill or disintegrated.</p>
