<p>Twitter people are very stupid. You do know Jake Paul and Logan Paul are Jews. Here is the video where their mom says. <a href="https://youtu.be/vUAfl-h5fkc?t=205">https://youtu.be/vUAfl-h5fkc?t=206</a></p>
 
 <p>I'm reading <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv18.pdf">https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv18.pdf</a>. I am attempting to interpret the data. It's complicated. Basically, there are approx 1.2 millions violent reported crimes each year in USA. But it depends on where you are getting your data from, because each has their own definition of 'violent crime.' So there are 1.18 million reported violent crimes each year, but if you count simple assaults, there are 2.78 million 'violent crimes' each year. Simple assaults basically means threats or failed attempts. These stats are so interesting. I have been the victim of a simple assault. This could mean threats are more prevalent than real crime. This makes sense. It all makes sense. People are always saying "Hey you, I'm gonna kill and rape you," but most people say 'that's not a violent crime.' But I am still reading because then there are unreported violent crimes. Basically, you double everything. But it's complicated, for example, the one I am reading for some unknown reason, excludes homicide from the data. I am still reading...</p>
 
 <p>Then, I am reading about black on black crime. It's complicated. I am still reading. But basically, dude it's crazy!! So they gave people surveys and basically black-on-white violent incidents = 547,948. black-on-black violent incident = 396,449. Black-on-white crime is more common than black-on-white crime. BUT the thing is it was all surveys. But I am still reading. It could also mean that white people are racist and saying "ugh I think it was a black man. But I am not certain." And all of this is per year! But it gets even more complicated!! There are violent incidents, and there is this whole another thing!! Basically, if a person got beat up 5 times in one year, that counts as 5 incidents. So what about if this changes the numbers. It's complicated. Then what about if one person got beat up by 5 people. Does that count as one incident or 5 incidents of violence???</p> 
 
 <p>The more I read about these crime stats. I feel schitzophrenic. Like there is going to be a civil war! It feels like they are a mistake. Like their race is the disease God warned us about. But I am not schitzophrenic Lol. I just enjoy thinking about a dystopian future. I have a lot of imagination. It's gets even more complicated when you count hispanics!!!! You know hispanics can be white people from spain but they can also be latinos from mexico. This messes up statistics. That's why I only focus on black crime. You just look at their skin tone and that's it.</p>
  
 <p>So in 2021 the FBI is coming out with some crazy computer system and basically crime stats are going to be more accurate.</p>
