<h1>Random</h1>
 <p>Call Her Daddy girls got exposed for always prentending to be poor on their podcast. Turns out they were earning $500,000 per year.</p>
<p>My sister's instagram is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/frenchfriesfrenchdogs/">@frenchfriesfrenchdogs</a>. I reported my sister to the Animal Control. Nothing happened.</p>
 
 <h1>My Biological Sister's First Dog</h1>
<p>My biological sister's first dog. It was a long time ago ~2005. The dog got his head stuck underneath a fence. The adults had to remove the fence to help release the dog. My biological father would always carry the dog by <a href="https://cdn.omlet.co.uk/images/originals/Dog-Dog_Guide-How_to_pick_up_a_puppy_by_the_scruff.jpg">pinching</a> the dog's loose skin-folds. I asked my father "Dad why do we carry dogs by its loose skin-folds?" My father replied "My friend is a dog breeder. It doesn't harm dogs. This is how dog's carry their offspring, by holding it on their scruffs. It teaches dogs how to respect humans." I replied "Would you atleast carry him with two of your hands?" My father replied "No. Dog's don't feel on their <a href="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/puppy-picked-up-scruff-neck-isolated-white-background-94959908.jpg">scruffs</a>." </p>
 
<h1>My Biological Father's Dogfighting Bloodsport</h1>
<p>I asked my biological father "Is it true that you hosted dogfighting events?" My biological father replied "Yes. I was young and naive. I did what I had to do to earn money. I regret allowing the dogs to fight eachother. I don't condone it anymore." I asked my biological father "Would the dogs fight to their deaths?" My biological father replied "No. I never allowed the dogs to die. The dogs would fight until they were bloody. Some dogs gave up, or the dog owners forfeited, or the judges concluded. But it was never deathly. I never made the dogs fight. Others brought their own dog. I simply hosted the events at my house. I charged a $50 entrance fee per spectator. That was how I earned money. If the cops showed up, I would have been the first one to get arrested because it was my house. Well actually it was your biological mother's house, but the cops never showed up."</p> 
 
 <h1>My Biological Sister's Second Dog</h1>
<p>~2016 My biological sister's friend said "Hello, do you want a dog? I have a dog. I don't want it anymore. If you don't take it. I will probably just send it to a shelter or something." My biological sister replied "Okay. I'll take your dog. This dog will teach my [biological] sons how to become responsible adults. My sons will sweep the dog poop everyday." My sister became the new owner of this dog. Several months later, that dog ranaway, got ran over by a car and died. The dog's name was Whisky.</p>
 
 <h1>My Biological Sister's Third and Fourth dogs (Ada + Bruce)</h1>
  
<p>On June 11, 2017 my sister purchased a French Bulldog that was named 'Ada'. Every few weeks, Ada ranaway and went missing for 6-12 hours, but was recovered at a neighbor's house. I said to my sister "If Ada keeps running away, that means you need to spay her to control her hormones. My sister replied "No. We are going to breed Ada to sell the offspring at $7,000 per puppy."</p>
 
 <p>Another instance, Ada ranaway and went missing for 1-2 weeks, my sister put up 'wanted' signs everywhere, but a person returned Ada to my sister. I asked my sister and her boyfriend "How did Ada escape?" My sister replied "My boyfriend's [biological] father is moving into the backhouse. He left the gate opened." My sister's boyfriend replied "Ada only ranaway one time. All the other times, Ada was just chilling at our neighbor's house. I think our neighbor is giving Ada hotdogs or something haha."</p>
 
 <p>Another instance, Ada ranaway and went missing for 3-4 weeks, my sister put up 'wanted' signs everywhere, but a stranger returned Ada to my sister and said "We found this homeless French Bulldog. We impregnanted her with another French Bulldog. We planned to sell the puppies. But when we saw the 'wanted' signs, we felt sorry that we took this dog away from a loving family. So we brought her back to you. Your dog is pregnant now. Here you go." I asked my sister "How did Ada escape again?" My sister replied "The Santa Ana wind broke our wooden <a href="https://www.shedshoustonfencedeckrepair.com/gallery/plog-content/images/fences/fence-installation/half-fence-fenced-yard-001c.jpg">fence-door</a>. We put Ada in a <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712MQC1dAdL._AC_SX425_.jpg">metal</a> enclosure but Ada jumped over it." </p>
 
 <h1>Ada's Puppies</h1>

 <p>On December 17, 2018 Ada gave birth to her first litter of 5 puppies. My sister sold 4 out of 5 puppies at thousands of dollars each. My sister and her boyfriend kept one puppy named Bruce, but they refused to neuter Bruce. My sister said "We are not going to take away Bruce's manhood. We are not going to pay for that unnecessary surgical process. If you want to neuter Bruce, go ahead, with your own money." It is mandatory to spay/neuter all dogs and cats <a href="https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT10AN_DIV1ANCO_CH10.20DOCASEAN_PT4MASPNEPRDOCA_10.20.350MASPNEDOCA">[1]</a>.</p>
  
 <p>Approx 6 months after Ada gave birth, Ada had a menstrual cycle; my sister's boyfriend took Ada to have artificial insemination. Two months later, the artificial insemination failed, Ada was not pregnant. It is illegal to whelp the same dog more than one time per 12 month period <a href="https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT10AN_DIV1ANCO_CH10.20DOCASEAN_PT1LI_10.20.045HOBRICREEE">[2]</a> <a href="https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT10AN_DIV1ANCO_CH10.20DOCASEAN_PT4MASPNEPRDOCA_10.20.360DEREUNDOCALIROPL">[3]</a> <a href="https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/registration/registering-your-pedigree-dog-litter/litter-registration-faqs/">[4]</a>. My sister purchased another female French Bulldog that was named 'Arya.' Arya was 7 weeks old when my sister purchased it. It is illegal to sell puppies that are fewer than 8 weeks old <a href="https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT10AN_DIV1ANCO_CH10.40GERE_10.40.200BRLIRERE">[5]</a>. Several months later, Arya ranaway but was never found.</p> 
  
 <p>On April 4, 2020 Ada gave birth to more puppies. Fewer than 8 weeks later, my sister sold one of Ada's puppies to a resident in San Francisco, CA. One night my sister got drunk and said "I love children. I have two sons. A household without children is lonely and depressing. I want to have more children, but giving birth is very painful and stressful on my body!" My sister says giving birth is painful. Every 6 months my sister forces Ada to produce puppies.</p>
 
 <h1>My Biological Sister's Goldfish</h1>
 
 <p>My sister had a tank with a few goldfish in it. One day my sister's boyfriend said "I purchased this other fish that eats algae, so we don't gotta clean the tank anymore." 1.5 year later, my sister went to my entire family and said "Do you want my fish? I don't want my fish anymore. I don't have time to feed them. If you don't take my fish, I am just going to flush them down the toilet." My sister does extortion. My sister basically said 'take my fish or else I will kill them.' I don't know what happened to her fish. I think she stopped feeding them and they died. I rarely go to my sister's house, mostly because of all the despicable things I see there.</p>
 
  <h1>The Reality of Instagram Photos</h1>
 
 <p>One night my sister got drunk and said "I never wanted to sell dogs, but my boyfriend convinced me to start selling dogs. I never wanted goldfish either, but my boyfriend convinced me. I didn't want to argue with him." My sister and her boyfriend are exactly like Brooke Houts, the woman who acted perfect on social media, the woman who acted like she loved dogs, but behind-the-cameras Brooke Houts was punching her dog. One time, I saw my sister's [biological] son punching their dog named Bruce. My siser's son yelled at Bruce "Go in the house! Go in the house!" My sister's son was young like 9 years old. I wonder where did he learn how to hit dogs? My sister has random fist-sized holes on her wall and door. I asked "How did this occur?" My sister said "Moving furniture."</p>
 
<h1>The Mexican Tow Business</h1>
<p>During 2018, my aunt said to me "Hey Jovanny, my co-worker has a virus on her personal laptop. Could you fix it?" The laptop had Windows 8, and pop-ups. I did a clean installation of Windows 10. Problem solved. I did not charge money for it."
 
<p>During 2019, my aunt said to me "Hey Jovanny, my co-worker says if you could fix her husband's business desktop computer?" The husband is Mexican, he owns a Tow Business. I went to the husband's Tow Business in Los Angeles, CA. The desktop computer had windows 7, pop-ups, and internet connectivity issues. I did a clean installation of Windows 10. Problem solved. I did not charge money for it.</p>
 
 <p>During 2019, my aunt said to me "Hey Jovanny, my co-worker says if you could fix her husband's personal desktop computer?" I did not notice any issues with the husband's personal desktop computer. I did a clean installation of Windows 10, firmware update, and touchscreen driver re-installation. I did not charge money for it. The husband gave me $80.</p>
 
<p>Here is the thing. I saw a huge folder of personal files on the husband's personal desktop computer. It was a lot of Gigabytes. I didn't want to wait a long time to backup his personal files. I clicked on "sort by filesize." I checked to see if there was anything I could delete. I was correct. There was one enormous video file that was one hour long. It was a video of the husband's children. The children started a webcam video and left it. The video was terrible quality. The video was mostly empty chair footage. I deleted several webcam videos. Videos take up a lot storage space. And I was not charging this man money! Nobody was going to miss those videos of literally an empty chair!</p>
 
 </p>But then I accidentally clicked on a video. It was a video of the Mexican husband forcing a gray pitbull dog to drink alcoholic beer. I still have the video on an SD card. It was despicable. There are 4 disgusting bearded mexican men. One man is holding the dog's mouth open. One man is holding a car funnel in the dog's mouth. One man is pouring a glass beer bottle in the car funnel. And there is a person holding the camera. They are all laughing at the dog. The dog has learned helplessness, which is when he doesn't fight back because he feels powerless. In the background there is a drinking water dispenser for the dog, and the water is brown! I don't know what to do. Noone cares about animals.</p> 
 
 <p>My mexican neighbors are breeding dogs. 
 
<p>My other mexican neighbors let their dogs roam free on public roads. 
 
 <p>In my city, I see random chickens roaming free on public roads.</p>
 
 <p>My other neighbor has two dogs and every 3-4 months they fight hardcore at 3:00AM! It sounds horrible. And last time we smelled something terrible coming from their trees. We notified the neighbor. And he said it was a dead possum or racoon.</p>

<p>And one time my aunt called the police because our other neighbor's dogs were fighting. For 1-2 weeks our neighbor's pitbull was bitting on the smaller dog. The smaller dog cried everyday at near 10:00PM. I stood outside and heard the mexican teenager pothead male neighbor say to the dogs "Shut the fuck up." Eventually, the animal control did arrive this time. Probably because a bunch of people called. I heard a deep voice say "Let me see your dogs." Then it was all quite. 1 hour later. The animal control left. A woman yelled "YOU FUCKEN BITCH I KNOW IT'S YOU" then her voice cracked and turned into a sad crying voice and she said "They are going to take away my dog! You happy now you fucking bitch!" She was talking to us.</p>
 
 <p>The first time I noticed our neighbor, I heard a deep incoherent voice yelling at someone. It only happened one time. During weekends, our neighbor smoked marijuana with friends while playing loud rap music. During the summer, our neighbor had a tiny inflatable pool. There were several mexican men. They had a girl sitting in the pool. They were drinking beer and smoking marijuana. There was no music. It was mostly one man talking very loudly. The man started talking not as loudly and said "Yeah dude. That was crazy. I never knew he would do that. He raped that woman. He straight up raped her. She was passed out drunk. She still doesn't know."</p>
 
 
 <h1>My Uncle and Oreo</h1>
 
 <p>My Uncle had a dog named Oreo. My uncle was a good dog owner, except for one thing, he always gave his dog Los Angeles Municpal Tap Water. I remember my uncle went to my house and said "Ew, your water has a disgusting plastic taste. Are you drinking tap water?" I said "No." My uncle replied "Maybe it doesn't have added minerals, or you need to wash the container." My uncle went to my bathroom and said "Why do you have Colgate toothpaste? You need to try Crest toothpaste." My uncle pulled out a chocolate bar from his pocket and said "This chocolate tastes gross." My uncle always said "I don't go to that restaurant. Their food tastes weird. I don't go to Walmart. I only shop at Target." </p>
 
 <p>I went to a fancy restaurant with my uncle, my uncle ordered a tall glass of water and my uncle said "Ew, this water tastes gross." I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with french fries, and my uncle angrily said "You can make that at your own house!" Then my grilled cheese sandwich and french fries arrived. My uncle was staring at my french fries. My uncle said "Jovanny, please let me have some of your fench fries?" My uncle always ate at fancy restaurants. Meanwhile, Oreo was drinking Los Angeles Municipal Tap Water and eating Pedigree.</p>
 
<p>Oreo got very old, and was diagnosed with cancer. Oreo had a lump underneath his skin. My uncle paid to have the lump removed. Oreo was a great dog. Oreo became so old that he was unable to walk. My uncle had to buy diapers for Oreo. My entire family said "It's time to say put him to rest." My uncle didn't want to. My uncle said "Oreo still has a few years left." The vet said "It's time to put him to rest." My uncle replied "No. Oreo still has a few more years left. He will wear diapers. I will clean him." Oreo started vomiting and choking on his pedigree food. Oreo only ate hotdogs. Oreo became worse and worse. Oreo slept in a soiled diaper right next to his own vomit. But no matter what. Oreo still humped his pillow for sexual gratification. He always did that.</p> 
  
<p>One night Oreo had a violent episode of coughing blood and vomiting. Everyone thought he was going to die right there. When my uncle euthanized Oreo, my uncle said "I imagined the drug would start working at 10-15 minutes. I thought I would have those 10-15 minutes to say goodbye, but the vet poked Oreo with a needle, and Oreo instantly died. One second he was there. Then he was gone." My uncle said "It's true. I should have euthanized Oreo a long time ago. I was selfish. I only cared about how much I was going to miss Oreo. But I wasn't thinking about Oreo's quality of life."</p>
  
 
 <h1>My Biological Sister's Weightloss Journey</h1>
 <p>Every few weeks, my sister says "I am on a keto diet," or "I am on a paleo diet," or "I am juice-cleansing." My sister paid $1,000 for a microwave machine that eliminates excess fat on the body (scam), she purchased it from her OBESE friend! My sister paid $60 for some mexican pills called 'Alipotec (Tejocote Root)' supposed to help you lose weight, and my sister said "I just kept on peeing and peeing all day. I peed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic">lot</a>" My sister purchased some $60 pills called 'Alli (Orlistat),' supposed to help you lose weight, and my sister said "I ate a greasy pizza. Several hours later. My butt was wet. I thought I peed myself. I went to the bathroom. It turns out my butthole was <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19587389/ns/health-diet_and_nutrition/t/diet-pills-icky-side-effects-keep-users-honest/">leaking</a> the oil from the pizza I ate." Every few months, my sister purchases some used workout contraption from OfferUp. One day my sister exclaimed "I downloaded an app on my smartphone that pays people money to lose weight! It's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HealthyWage">HealthyWage</a> App!"</p>
 
 <h1>My Biological Sister's Alcoholism Journey</h1>
 <p>A doctor told my sister that her liver was diseased. My sister said "I am not going to drinking alcohol anymore. Alcohol is bad for my liver." My sister ranover a fire-hydrant with her car while driving during a hangover, my sister said "I am not drinking alcohol anymore."</p>
 
 <p>My sister required my help to install Microsoft Office on her laptop. I went to her house, and my sister and her boyfriend were just drinking beer all day and arguing, my sister said to her boyfriend "You signed up for a free-trial of HBO and Hulu, you said you were going to cancel the free-trials, but they have overcharged us all these months!" My sister's boyfriend replied "Relax. It's not a big deal. You're the one who uses these services the most." My sister said "I only watch Netflix and Amazon."</p>
 
 <p>A few days later, I saw my biological sister and her boyfriend at a family party. My sister was drinking beer and said "I got my gallblader and appendix surgically removed." My sister's boyfriend said "I know this guy that hacks internet modems. Normally internet costs $70. But I got free unlimited internet because of this guy I know. You just pay him $250. It's been years that we've had free unlimited internet. My other friend hacks Amazon Fire TV Sticks, he put Popcorn Time on my computer. But we got a letter from our ISP that warned us to stop watching illegal movies online or else they will cancel our internet, we got the same warning 2 times already."</p> 
 
 <p>I said "Are you addicted to alcohol?" My sister said "No." My sister's boyfriend said "Nah. It's just that everytime you see us, you only see us during holidays and parties such as today." I said "What about a few days ago, I saw you drinking beer at your house." My sister's boyfriend replied "That was just one time. It was during a Sunday afternoon."<p>
 
 <p>A few days later, I went to my sister's house to install Ikea furniture. My sister and her boyfriend were both drinking beer with a bunch of friends not celebrating anything. There was an obese woman who never moved from her chair. The obese woman was always sitting down, but only her lips moved. And all day long the obese woman was talking "Monica, is dating this guy Julio. Julio has no job. He even says he doesn't need a job. He just lives with his parents and drinks beer everyday. He's ugly." My sister said "But Monica, is so beautiful why would she?" Then the obese woman whispered "Monica got drunk at Las Vegas, and said she only stays with Julio because he is great at Cunnilingus."</p>
