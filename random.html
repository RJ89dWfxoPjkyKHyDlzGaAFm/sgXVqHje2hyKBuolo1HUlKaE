<p>Do these people even know the shoes they are looting are manufactured by actual slaves in 3rd world countries. They worship shoes made by slaves.</p>
 <p>You are on the wrong side of the war. All the nonwhite Black Lives Matter people abuse animals, abuse their children, and abuse their wives. I know it. I am chicano. I see it everyday. My mexican father abandoned me. My mexican father never paid child support money, but he drives expensive cars. One day my mexican father took my young sister to a mexican man named Salatiel. The mexican man named Salatiel sexually abused my mexican sister.</p>
  
<p>My mexican mother believes in witchcraft. My mexican mother committed infidelity on my father believing that her dreams predicted the future. My mexican mother raised me. She gave me food, water, and shelter. But she never warned me about the dangers of drugs. My mexican mother never talked me. My mexican mother never taught me any life lessons. I was expected to learn about the world all alone. Whenever I asked my mother a question, she would only yell at me. One day my teacher gave me a homework assignment to discuss a questionnaire with my parent. The first question was "What is your ethnicity?" I asked my mother "what does ethnicity mean?" and my mother yelled at me. So I cried to my mother "I am never going to do my homework ever again!" My mother replied "I don't care." So I never did a homework assignment ever again and didn't finish high school. It was too late when I realized I misbehaved in order to spite my mother because of a grudge I held onto from childhood.</p>
