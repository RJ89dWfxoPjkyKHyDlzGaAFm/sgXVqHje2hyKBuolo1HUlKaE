<p>Here is a video about a white guy who accidentally killed someone while drunk driving, he ran them over. He went to prison. Because he was small skinny and white. A bunch of black dudes hardcore raped him until his butthole was bleeding they laughed at his face. He got HIV from it. Now he is going to die <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1knkqH4Vi8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1knkqH4Vi8</a>. What's worse? Being raped by a bunch of black dudes till you got HIV? or dying from a knee on your neck?</p>
