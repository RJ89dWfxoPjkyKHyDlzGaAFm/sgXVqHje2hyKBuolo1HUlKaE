<h1>Random</h1>
 
 <p>I am thinking about paying for website hosting. I will have more control over my website. Specifically, I want to password restrict sections of my website.</p>
 <p>I got rid of clutter from my website. I am going to make a Facebook account to ask Elizabeth if I could publish her own autobiography "How I Became a Supernova" onto my website.</p>

 <p>Things are getting worse for me. There is only one trajectory.</p>

 <p>April 29, 2020. Today is not a good day for me.</p>
