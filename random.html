 <p>I swear to fucking God. About 3-5 years ago. I was at Taco Bell near my house. All the employee were African-American. All of them.</p>
 <p>I ordered some tacos. Man they took a long time! I was sitting there waiting. And the whole time all the African-American employees were talking and laughing. I swear to God. I was the only customer. And one African-American man said "She was so hot. I needed to fuck. She made me wait 2 whole damn years for sex. But damn she was hot. She was hot like damn. So I waited and waited. I didn't have sex for 2 years. And then boom. She let me fuck her pussy. The next day I cheated on her." 
  
 <p>Then all the African-American laughed so hard. They were like "Nah. Nah. Bruh!"</p>
 <p>I'm telling you Black Men ain't shit! Black Lives Matter people are so stupid! I mean what the fuck! Do you actually need school to teach you to do not kill rape and burglarize?? These black people are not stealing food! They are stealing shoes and macbooks! They don't need any of those things!</p>
