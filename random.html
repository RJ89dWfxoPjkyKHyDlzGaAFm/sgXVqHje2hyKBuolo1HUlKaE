 <p>I got rid of clutter from my website. I am going to make a Facebook to ask Elizabeth if I could publish her own autobiography "How I Became a Supernova" onto my website.</p>
 <p>Things are getting worse for me. There is only one trajectory.</p>
 
 <p>A long time ago, this girl at my High School wrote a very short memoir about her life. I read it. I am a character in her memoir! Her memoir was titled "How I became a supernova." *plot spoilers* She became a supernova when she got pregnant and her boyfriend said "Wow your skin is flush and bright red like a supernova!" I am searching for it on facebook. I am going to message her if I can upload it to my website. It was good. She could probably sell her book for a ton of money lol. But if she says no, then I am going to only put the one paragraph where she mentioned my name lol! ... Okay. So I found the <a href="https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/1560404_821676444524412_1755811126_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&_nc_sid=da1649&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&_nc_ohc=q1xrr0LzWVwAX_SteM4&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&_nc_tp=14&oh=adef59f12dbc1084066f94b89bc931ac&oe=5EE96533">artwork</a> she had for her book. Who made it? Weird. I couldn't find the book on her facebook. So that means I gotta message her and ask if she still has a copy of her book. It was a Micrsoft Word document. I really do not want to message her. What should I do? I am thinking I gotta pay her $1,000 so I can purchase the legal rights to publish her book on my website.</p>
 
 <p>Okay. Here are a list of topics I might write about on my Website: My Mom's Second Divorce, The Rodney King Conversation + Mario, How I Became a Supernova book, My Crackhead Cousin Andrea, My Cousins Chris, My Dad's Car Theft, When My Uncle Attempted Suicide, My White Neighbor Thomas, When Daisy Showed Us Her Breasts, The Crazy Sex Cult, and When I Was Almost Kidnapped. I also MIGHT start an instagram OR upload photos of my life. </p>
 <p>April 29, 2020. Today is not a good day for me.</p>
