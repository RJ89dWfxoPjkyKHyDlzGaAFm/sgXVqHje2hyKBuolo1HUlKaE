 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qggoumYi0">Life is Beautiful</a><br> My favorite movie. This film contains an obvious liberal agenda to portray the Third Reich as purely evil, and Jews as purely innocent victims. My 5th grade teacher showed me this film. I remember being told by my 5th grade teacher "Nazis killed anyone who had no blonde hair and blue eyes." I remember thinking to myself "That is a stupid reason to go to war."<br> I would like to see a movie that portrays the Third Reich as the heros who lost, but liberal media would not allow it. What I like about this film was the character development for Guido Orefice. Guido Orefice did everything in his power to bring joy and happiness towards the only two persons within his life, his wife and child. Guido Orefice did all this while living in a cruel disgusting reality called Earth. The movie is titled "Life is Beautiful," but I believe the title was the director's sneery way of saying "Life is actually quite ugly."  </p>
