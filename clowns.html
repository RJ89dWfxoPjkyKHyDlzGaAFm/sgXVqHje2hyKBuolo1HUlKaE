<p>If you don't write your pronouns in your bio, that means you are homophobic. If you say "I'm not interested in politics" that means you voted for Donald Trump. If you say "I don't see color" that means you are racist. Now, if you say "Rap music is more violent compared to pop music", that means you are racist. California just passed leglislation making it illegal to use rap lyrics as evidence in court.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/mxcR97E2xmo?t=151">Explanation by Philip DeFranco</a></p>

<p>Rap lyrics were used in court 500 times <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artists-industry-leaders-legal-experts-join-together-to-protect-black-art-301664431.html">1</a>. Non-rap lyrics were used in court only 4 times. This can only be explained by racism. And in response, Jaynee LaVecchia said "No one actually believes Bob Marley killed a sheriff <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/08/05/bob-marley-didnt-shoot-the-sheriff-a-court-has-ruled-here-are-six-other-crimes-that-were-not-committed-in-popular-songs/">1</a>." Of course, liberals want to protect your freedom of speech to sing about killing police officers.</p>

<p>Anerae Veshaughn Brown, also known as X-Raided, is an african-american man who murdered a <b>woman</b>, bragged about killing her in his rap music, and was sentenced to prison for 31 years. According to the woke mob, Anerae was wrongfully convicted. So that's where all this new legislation stems from.</p>

<p>Also, Anerae wrote songs about killing and raping <b>women</b>. Basically, his lyrics said "I was walking on the streets, when I saw a sexy woman, but if I kill her, that would make her pussy dry, so that's why I raped her alive, and her screams made my dick go harder."</p>

<p>You can literally rap about killing and raping women, and they will give you a million dollar record deal. Meanwhile, in Austria, they sentenced a man to 10 years in prison for "glorifying Adolf Hitler" through his lyrics.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, here is Lyor Cohen, the owner of Warner Music Group. They asked him "What do you think about the drug crisis in america?" Lyor Cohen replied "I am very passionate about helping drug addicts seek mental treatment." They replied "If you care so much about drug addiction, why does your record label promote rappers who glorify drug addiction?" Lyor Cohen replied "Stop it. You are being very anti-semitic against me."</p>

<p>The full video is actually much worse. Basically, Lyor Cohen said "I don't care about the money. All I care about is helping talented artists find their audience. And I knew if I depicted drug abuse in my music label, it would draw attention to that issue of drug addiction. In the long term, this is better for society. So you see, in reality, I'm a good guy. I am trying to raise awareness, so we can have a conversation about this topic, like how are we going to fix this."</p>
