<h1>My Personal Anecdote</h1>
<p>I had 5 rabbits who I raised since they were hairless newborns. In the beginning, my newborn rabbits were very friendly and docile. Several months later, when puberty happened to my young rabbits, all my female rabbits remained very friendly and docile; but all my male rabbits started violently urinating, raping, and attacking each other game of thrones style. Here is a photo I found online of a rabbit who lost his eye from fighting other rabbits 
<a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/15722/do-rabbits-fight-each-other-to-the-death">1</a>. This is how visciously my male rabbits fought, but luckily never lost an eye.</p>
<p>I tried training my male rabbits, for them to stop fighting, but it was an utter failure. One time, a male rabbit latched his teeth into my arm and humped his erect penis on my hand. One time, a male rabbit attacked another male rabbit, there was blood on their lips.</p>
<p>The reason why I tried training them is because I was uninformed. I thought there was something that I was not giving them that they needed. I tried giving them the most expensive food and hay, I gave them the purest reverse osmosis water, I gave them plenty of space to roam free, I gave them my daily supervision and attention.</p> 
<p>A long time ago, when my rabbits were still drinking their mother's milk, my friend asked me "Are you going to neuter them?" I replied "No. That is barbaric and unnatural. I am just going to separate them by genders." Soon I changed my opinion.</p>
<p>After doing research online, I learned that male rabbits fight because of a chemical called testosterone. 95% of testosterone is produced by the testes. Castration significantly reduces testosterone and unwanted sexually dimorphic behaviours. Spaying reduces ovarian cancer in rabbits.</p>
<p>With this new information, I had all my rabbits spayed and neutered. The differences I noticed after their castration is my male rabbits seemed docile and civilized, they expressed zero desire to rape, the seemed less jittery and less impulsive. The castration didn't stop my male rabbits from being violent towards eachother, however, I believe this violence is a learned behavior from their fights in the past like they want revenge. My female rabbits remained the same, docile and friendly.</p>

<h1>Evidence</h1>
<p>Page 23 of "Booklet 1: Executive Summary, UNODC Global Study on Homicide 2019," says 94% of convicted killers worldwide are male. 81% of homicide victims are male.</p>
<p>When I was reading this, I remembered how my male rabbits were violent, and I remembered how my female rabbits were docile. After more research, I learned that male rabbits are not the only animals who fight. Many species all around the world, it is always the males who fight while the women remain docile. Here is a small list I created as examples: <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VWFreC4onI">beatles</a>, betta fish <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0yuOSUSEs">bison</a>, <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWtwxurMJNQ">elephants</a>, equine, <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_akd-o3ppAE">giraffes</a>, <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCcLMNcWZOc">kangaroos</a>, rabbits, <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez7RUSCUhzk">rams</a>, roosters, <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a8ncofVDuY">snakes</a>, <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHuqeIP3_HQ">zebras</a>.

<p>Dmitry Belyayev designed an experiment of artificial selection on wild foxes <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox">7</a>. Wild foxes are crazy savage violent animals who attack humans. Dmity Belyayev's assistant was Lyudmila Trut. The experiment began in 1952 when Lyudmila Trut visited a fur farm. At the fur farm, Lyudmila Trut tested the personalities of the hundreds of foxes until finally Lyudmila Trut had selected 30 male foxes and 100 female foxes who seemed to be the least savage. The 30 male foxes mated with the 100 female foxes. There were hundreds of foxes in cages. Each month the foxes were evaluated and given an objective "tameness score." The foxes with the highest "tameness score" were allowed to reproduce, the foxes with the lowest "tameness score" were disallowed. After 40 years of doing this experiment with 45,000 foxes, the newer generation of foxes became docile and domesticated. The brains of these domesticated foxes changed genetically. The foxes were never trained by humans. The foxes remained in cages with limited human contact, which proves their behavior changed with genetics, not education. Dmitry Belyayev's experiment was validated by scientists in denmark with mink animals. Dmitry Belyayev also showed it was possible to create violent foxes by artificial selection too. This is why human eugenics is necessary. Human eugenics is going to either fix or collapse society depending on which direction it goes. Humans are exactly like Dmitry Belyayev's foxes.</p>

<p>I do not want a government mandated eugenics program. I believe a feminist movement will rise to inspire women to stop producing offsprings with psychopaths. Women should be allowed to have sex with whoever, but choose wisely who they will produce offsprings with. For example, I am a short, ugly, balding man, so if I were to have children, I would search for someone who is smarter than me, and ask them to donate their eggs/sperm.</p>
