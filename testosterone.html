<p>All of humanity's problems are caused by hormones. Hormones make us emotional, while emotional we behave irrationally. The most dangerous hormone is testosterone. Testosterone may effect baldness, pubic hair, and vocal pitch in some humans. In others, testosterone effects psychopathy which means very low empathy. Scientists could predict criminality, by observing the effect testosterone made to the brain's structure. A testosterone sensitive brain develops uniquely. Higher levels of testosterone does not cause psychopathy. For example, higher levels of testosterone does not cause baldness, humans with very low testosterone can still go bald, because baldness depends on the hair follicle's testosterone sensitivity. So a human with very low testosterone can still be a psychopath, because psychopathy depends on the brain's testosterone sensitivity during brain development, some brains are more sensitive than others.</p>

<p>Supposedly, spearmint tea lowers both Total and Free testosterone by 23% and 29% for human females <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ptr.2900">1</a>, it probably lowers testosterone for human males too.</p>

<p>Roughly 33% of female prisoners identify as lesbian or gay <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/overwhelming-number-lesbians-bisexual-women-incarcerated-n728666">1</a>. This is evidence that high androgen sensitivity increases aggression in women too.</p>
