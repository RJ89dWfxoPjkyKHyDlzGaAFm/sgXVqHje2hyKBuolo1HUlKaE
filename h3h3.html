<p>I can't take this fucking bullshit anymore. I need to speak up about this.</p>

<p>First off, I was scrolling through Craig's twitter, clicked on the wrong link, and it fucking took me to real child porn. Second off, I was just scrolling through craig's twitter, and I would just see dozens of photoshopped images of Kanye West fucking Nick Fuentes in the asshole. I saw dozens of photoshopped images of Kanye West, Nick Fuentes, and Ethan Ralph with cartoon cum all over their faces. I saw an edited video of Ethan Ralph getting his ass fucked by ten black men.</p>

<p>And then I went on Ethan Klein's twitter, and I saw Andrew Tate having sex with Adin Ross. I fucking lost my fucking mind. What the fuck is this disguting sadistic bullshit man. It's fucking evil dude.</p>

<p>They laugh at the idea of their enemies being raped. And don't you fucking dare tell me "that's not rape, it's consensual, Adin Ross likes it."</p>

<p>First off in Abhu Graib, they forced muslims to have sex with other muslims, and the perpetrators laughed about it, and took pictures.</p>

<p>Second off, read this wikipedia.</p>

<p>A jewish man wrote a book titled <i>Lolita</i>, that's why Jeffrey Epstein's plane is called <i>Lolita Express</i>. The book is about a 40 year old man who has sex with a 12 year old girl, and in the book, the man said "Was this your first time?" And the girl said "No, I had sex with my other classmates" and the man broke the fourth wall and said "So you see, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I did nothing wrong, she was all over me, girls are horny at the age of 12. The end." Every country in the world tried to ban this book, but no matter what, all the courts said "It's not pedophilia. The girl was asking for it." So then a bunch of feminists got together and said "That's because the book is written in the perspective of the perpetrator. Of course from his perspective it seems consensual."</p>

<p>So that's what I mean man. In Ethan Klein's sick twisted mind, he thinks Andrew Tate and Adin Ross are having consensual sex. But in reality, he is just forcing two men to have sex and laughing about it.</p>

<p>And also, I messaged Mky-biz on discord, I asked him to send me the audio recording of the MTG swatting, and he fucking blocked me. And I heard a rumor mky-biz is jewish. And I don't know man. I scrolled fast through his discord. I blocked it from my brain. But I am pretty sure it was a gang of men sharing thousands of cartoon furry porn, but some of it looked like it was a tiny half-child/half-animal being vaginally penetrated by a giant animal penis. My eyes were open, but my brain turned off. I didn't want to believe I was seeing what I thought it was. I just ignored it and said "Maybe it's not a child, maybe it's my mind playing tricks on me, fuck it, ignore it, I am not here for that, I am here to message mky-biz."</p>

<p>WTF is this bullshit. Sometimes I feel sorry for doxing Craig Daniel Mansfield, sometimes I feel like what if I got the wrong guy, but then I remember sh*t like this and I fucking know I got the right guy. I fucking hate this shit. Every single god damn fucking time I investigate craig or Ethan Klein, it just keeps getting worse and worse dude. Satanic shit. And nobody fucking believes me, everyone thinks I'm crazy.</p>

<p>I literally stopped watching the H3 podcast because of this exact episode where Ethan described Gaston raping LeFou "Ph yeah, Gaston, I love it when you dress me up like a girl and fuck me in my asshole, Gaston, oh yeah."</p>

<p>And Ethan said "In Star Wars, the Jedi are pedophiles." So I actually heard on Film Theory youtube channel that the Jedi abused children, because they kidnapped orphans and forced them to join the army. The jedi are evil, Darth Vader was the real hero. BUT WTF DUDE. To say it was pedophilia, WTF.</p>

<p>Hell no dude. I am 100% convinced Ethan Klein watched star wars themed child porn, and that's where he got the idea. That's why I stopped listening to the H3 podcast, hell no dude, I'm literally fucking traumatized by the shit that comes out of Ethan Klein's imagination. Like the time Ethan said "Some kids lives are about to change forever" or the time Ethan said "I jack off to child porn when my wife Hila is in the bathroom lol just kidding <a href="https://youtu.be/icFV7iTkH_Y?t=730">1</a>" I literally have nightmares of Ethan Klein raping me. And I just feel sad and hopeless every time I go in the comments and girls are saying "Wow Ethan Klein is such an amazing good person." I am fucking serious dude. I feel shy and embarrassed to say it. Like people will say I'm gay or weak because Ethan Klein raped me in my nightmares. He's fucking evil dude.</p>
