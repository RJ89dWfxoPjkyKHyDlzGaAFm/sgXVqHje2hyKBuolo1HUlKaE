<h1>I changed my mind. This is the worst thing Ethan has ever said.</h1>
<p><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://twitter.com/McHaloson/status/1530427352341020672">https://twitter.com/McHaloson/status/1530427352341020672</a></p>

<p>Ethan said "Today there is going to be an NRA meeting in Texas, someone should go bomb those rednecks." He said "I wish someone would do a mass shooting at Ted Cruz's house, to teach him a lesson." He said "I will be so happy if someone killed Greg Abbott." He said "Somebody needs to do a mass shooting at Walmart, only rednecks shop there." I am telling you, Ethan is worse than Alex Jones, and Tucker Carlson. No wonder I'm so crazy. It's cuz I've been listening to Ethan Klein the entire time. Ethan Klein radicalized me.</p>

<p>That's how it works around here. Ethan sends death threats to whoever he wants. He calls people faggots and cucks. And the moment you say one criticism about Ethan, all of sudden, he reports you for anti-semitism, and your twitter gets deleted.</p>

<h1>Ethan's true opinions on Black Lives Matter</h1>
<p>Ethan said "If you think I am racist, kill yourself."</p>

<p>Ethan got pissed off cuz they told him he must hire black employees.</p>
<img src="images\ethanracist.webp">
<img src="images\ethanracist2.webp">
<p>Ethan uses black models to advertise his merch, but he banned black people being on his podcast, because he can't stand hearing their opinions. Also, Ethan has never in his entire life ever interacted with a black person. He only hires black people and Indians to be his security guards because he doesn't want whites to die.</p>


<h1>Ethan's opinions of Gun Control</h1>
<p>Ethan said "If a burglar broke into my house, I will shoot him seven times with my semi-automatic shot gun, to protect my family."<a aria-hidden="true" href="https://twitter.com/stclairashley/status/1530695251198894080">https://twitter.com/stclairashley/status/1530695251198894080</a>So Ethan thinks it's okay for us to kill burglars, but it's not okay for the police to kill burglars.<br><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1514501126715969536">https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1514501126715969536</a><br>Ethan feels entitled to kill burglars because he got swatted. Hundreds of celebrities have been swatted, including Justin Bieber, and yet Ethan is the only one who cries out anti-semitism.<p>

<h1>Ethan's final solution to anti-semitism</h1>
<p>Ethan said "We need to holocaust rednecks before they holocaust us. Some people are too dumb to live. Incinerate them."</p>
<p><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/6aHBrtMnxY0?t=48">https://youtu.be/6aHBrtMnxY0?t=48</a></p>

<h1>Ethan wishes death to all anti-vaxers</h1>
<p><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\antivax.webm"></audio></p>
<p>And here Ethan said "I hope wendy williams dies from COVID-19, because she is a stupid anti-vaxer."</p>
<p><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\evil3.webm"></audio></p>
<p>Ethan said "I'm glad Herman Cain died, because he was a stupid anti-vaxer.</p>
<p><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\herman.webm"></audio></p>

<h1>Ethan got COVID two times!</h1>
<p>Fun Fact: Ethan Klein is quadruple vaccinated, and yet he still got hospitalized for COVID-19. The only reason he survived is because he has white privilege and can afford the best doctors. Also, Keemstar said "I hope Ethan dies from Covid-19" and Ethan cried out "anti-semitism reeee! anti-semitism! call the police! ban keemstar! reee!" Ethan nearly had a heart attack from hearing so much anti-semitism. This is the pig squeeling noise Ethan makes whenever he perceives anti-semitism. Coincidentally, it's the same noise a devil makes when he's been exposed.</p>
<p><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\squeeling.webm"></audio></p>
<p><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\money.webm"></audio></p>
<p>That's a real sound recording of Ethan confessing his love for money. Ethan only has two emotions. 1. pig squeeling, and 2. Money, money, money, I love money.</p>

<h1>The real reason Ethan hates antivaxers</h1>
<p>The reason Ethan wants to kill antivaxers is because antivaxers are antisemitic. So if you are racist against blacks, Ethan says "It's never too late to change for the better üëèüòà. You have to forgive me, or else you are a bitter person." But if you are antisemitic, Ethan says "It's too late for them to change, kill them!"</p>

<h1>The End of Comedians</h1>
<p>Comedy needs government reform. Would you describe BlackFace as having comedic value? I believe comedy is glorified bullying. Look at 4chan.org, their form of comedy is "Let's kill all n*ggers and jews hahaha." I believe we need to punish people who make inappropriate jokes. Starting with Ethan Klein. His form of comedy is using the n word, doing blackface, and slut shaming. From now on, you need consent from the person being made fun of, or else you can't call yourself a comedian, then you're just a bully. Bullying causes mass shooters, mass shooters cause world wars. Government regulation of comedy is not a regression of society. Comedy adds nothing of value to any meaningful intelligent conversation. Comedy is leisure time for idiots. Look at Jack Ass, people laugh because men are getting kicked in the balls. We should strive for a society where comedians do not exist anymore. Sadly, I think the world is not ready to cancel comedians just yet.</p>

<h1>Jordan Peterson's Nightmare</h1>
<p><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/eZYbxWxDG3I?t=2742">https://youtu.be/eZYbxWxDG3I?t=2742</a></p>
<p>Summary: Jordan Peterson had a nightmare that he was being molested by his grandmother. So Ethan bullies him "Hahaha, you had a wet dream, you have an incest fantasy, redneck."</p>

<p>Some women have orgasms during rape, and idiots like Ethan say "you had an orgasm, means you liked it, hahaha" Some boys get molested, their dick gets hard, so they feel ashamed.</p>

<p>And plus it's called Vicarious Traumatization. You don't have to be raped to feel the consequences of rape. Just hearing a rape victim speak is enough to make you cry, and can leave you traumatized. I have a friend who attempted suicide, she posted a suicide note online, she was a social worker, everyday she would hear horrific stories about child abuse, until one day she felt hopeless, and powerless, so she attempted suicide. Jordan Peterson is a clinical psychologist, he hears too many stories about rape, so he went home and had a nightmare about it. It's called empathy. Ethan doesn't have empathy. The only thing Ethan dreams about is money, money, money.</p>


<h1>Ethan Says All Sluts Have Loose Vaginas</h1>

<p>Ethan says Mike Majlak is pathetic for dating the pornstar Lana Rhoades. Ethan says all sluts, milfs, and pornstars have loose vaginas, and only a cuck would dare to fuck a loose vagina like Lana Rhoades. Hila got outraged. Also, Ethan said "Gay men have loose assholes, it's a scientific fact <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/VWgVZRN7xLQ?t=312">1</a>."</p>


<p>Ethan Klein's second bestfriend Hasan Piker got caught having non consensual sex with human trafficking victims, everyone who mentioned it got banned from twitter <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://twitter.com/realalexrubi/status/1448778917301657602">1</a>, for hate speech, for being a "Sex Worker Exclusionary Radical Feminist (SWERF)", and then they gave Hasan Piker a job promotion. Hasan Piker said "Human trafficking is a republican issue, not a democrat issue. I don't feel sorry for my actions. It wasn't my fault. If we lived under communism, human trafficking would cease to exist." Bitch, fuck you, does it look like we're living under communism? Hey guys, under communism, global warming wouldn't exist, therefore I'm allowed to own a lamborghini. The main reason women do sex work is for money. Under communism, money would not be an issue. Therefore, under communism there would be far fewer sex workers.</p>

<p>Here is a video of Ethan saying "Deep down, every woman has a rape fantasy."</p>

<h1>Sexism</h1>
<p>Ethan said "I feel sorry for male victims of sexual abuse." Here is Ethan not giving a f*ck about the male victim of sexual abuse Spencer Elden. Spencer Elden is the naked baby on the Nirvana album cover. Spencer Elden filed a lawsuit claiming to be a victim of child pornography. Ethan described Spencer Elden's lawsuit as "obviously a cashgrab." Ethan believes Spencer Elden is acting like a victim for financial gain.</p>

<p>The album cover Virgin Killer (1976) by Scorpions featured a photo of a naked female child, and it was immediately banned from the UK for child pornography. That is literally sexism. If you show a naked boy it's "art" but if you show a naked girl it's child pornography. The porn actresses Lana Rhoades and Mia Khalifa both believe if a woman does porn and later regrets doing porn, she should have the legal right to delete her porn videos; at the moment this is illegal, because pornstars don't own their own porn, porn companies own it. Why is it different if Spencer Elden wants to delete his naked photo from an album cover? Also, Ethan got angry when Gabi DeMartino posted her naked childhood photos. Ethan is a heterosexual pedophile. Everytime he sees a naked girl, his dick gets hard, so he wants to ban it. But when he sees a naked boy, his dick doesn't get hard, so he says it's "art."</p>

<p>And here is Ethan Klein saying "Ryan Kavanugh is a cuck!"</p>

<h1>Ethan Hates Black Beauty Products</h1>
<p>Everytime you go to Walmart, the black beauty products are always locked up because of racist white men like Ethan Klein. This video shows, Ethan hates Tyra Banks simply because Tyra loves vaseline.</p>
<p><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/yPkOYgLgGBk">https://youtu.be/yPkOYgLgGBk</a></p>

<p>Lotions such as vaseline are an essential part of black culture because dry skin appears white and flakey on dark skin tones. Bill Burr, who is currently married to a black woman, Bill Burr once said "As a white person, if you don't know about lotion, it means you're racist, like you don't have any black friends to tell you about lotion <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/RiH-_ZUILk0">1</a>." Black women are known for doing the "slugging" technique where vaseline is applied liberally to the face. Hating vaseline is like hating black culture.</p>

<h1>Ethan spent decades hating palestine. But when Gal Gadot was cancelled for hating palestine, suddenly Ethan turned into a "lover of palestine."</h1>

<p>Based on episode "H3 Podcast #38 - Hila Klein," Ethan and Hila ran away from Israel to get away from the evil palestinian terrorists. Ethan Klein said it is "super ignorant" to believe palestinians and israelis could live peacefully without borders. Hila Klein replied "When I grew up, I couldn't even ride a bus, because I was too afraid of being blown up by terrorists, and the Gaza wall did help." Ethan described Israel's military as "innovative." During episode #9, Ethan explained his political philosophy on immigration and refugees as "When you save one life, you save the whole world <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/IHL6HazIfQ0?t=2502">2</a>." In other words, Ethan wants open borders in the United States, but closed borders in Israel.

<p><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\refugees.webm"></audio></p>

<p>Hila Klein says the United States should be strict against white supremacy exactly like Israel is strict against palestine. When Hila Klein said "But there is nothing happening here," she means the United States is doing nothing to stop white supremacy.</p>
<p><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\gadot.webm"></audio></p>

<p>On May 12, 2021 Gal Gadot was canceled on twitter for criticizing palestine. On May 15, 2021 suddenly Ethan tweeted his own support for palestine <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1393699395586052098">1</a>. Ethan Klein and Hila Klein frequently change their opinions to avoid being canceled. Ethan Klein described Israel's military as "innovative," but he also described the United State's military as "corruption."</p>
<p><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\corruption.webm"></audio></p>
<p>Don't you you guys see what is happening here? Ethan is a traitor and a foreign invader! He was sent here to destroy America!</p>

<h1>Ethan owns multiple mansions, and armed security guards to protect himself from "White Supremacy."</h1>
<p>Here is proof. Dirt.com says "The Kleins' $9 million property is located within a 24/7 guard-gated community, a lavish manor in Bel Air <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.dirt.com/entertainers/influencers/ethan-klein-house-bel-air-1203300328/">1</a>." Aegis.com says it specializes in protecting "Jewish temples, and high net worth individuals located in Bel Air <a href="https://www.aegis.com/security-los-angeles-county/security-bel-air/">2</a>." Dirt.com also says "besides their new $9 million mansion, records reveal the Kleins still own a $2.3 million Encino house, and another $780,000 Woodland Hills house.</p>

<h1>Donation Shaming</h1>
<p>Remember that one time Ethan got accused of "Donation Shaming people" and Ethan completely denied it. Here is proof Ethan donation shames people. Pauly Shore donated $5 to Ethan's livestream, and Ethan immediately searched up Pauly Shore's net worth on google.com, and Ethan commanded Pauly Shore to donate more money. Ethan's net worth was $20 million. Pauly Shore's was $30 million. If you are $1 richer than Ethan, that means you owe Ethan money.<audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\shore1.webm"></audio></p>

<h1>Hate Speech (1984)</h1>
<p>Ethan says the word "female" is hate speech. Consequently, Ethan banned the word "female" from his whole entire workplace. On episode "H3TV #11" Ethan's employee AB Ayad got in trouble for accidentally uttering the word female. According to Ethan, the politically correct word for "female" is "women."</p>

<p>1.5 months later, and Ethan is outraged because youtube does not allow him to utter the word "cunt." Also, Ethan tweeted "Our government is run by cunts <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1342219282625699840">1</a>." And Ethan constantly uses the words "bitch, pussy, and cunt" to describe people. In Ethan's mind, you are not allowed to call women cunts, you are only allowed to call straight white men cunts, because there is no history of oppression against straight white men <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1470971707338878982">2</a>.Also, Ethan said "Kim Kardashian is an obnoxious bitch <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/_VovzI50yC4?t=13135">1</a>." And Hila got outraged.</p>

<p><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/DdpkW14cShk?t=600">https://youtu.be/DdpkW14cShk?t=600</a><br>Long story short, in 2017 <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/h3h3defensefund">1</a>,<a aria-hidden="true" href="https://kotaku.com/payday-2-makers-donate-dlc-profits-to-help-big-youtuber-1795126319">2</a>, a secretive organization known as Starbreeze Studios paid Ethan $1 million bucks to shill anti-white propaganda. Ethan's clothing brand Teddy Fresh is money laundering. Ethan's H3 podcast is a psy-op paid for by the Israeli Defense Force. If you don't believe me, you must ask yourself, why would a random person donate $1 million to Ethan? Almir Listo and Ethan Klein are not even bestfriends or anything like that. It is obvious, Almir Listo thought to himself "I'm white. Ethan is white. I believe in socialism. Ethan believes in socialism. I am going to donate $1 million to Ethan because I love white people who believe in socialism just like me." Ethan got $1 million for being born white.</p>

<h1>Vegans tried to cancel Ethan for purchasing Shredder. Suddenly, Ethan "rescued" Alfredo.</h1>
<p>The only reason Ethan rescued Alfredo is because there was a hate mob. And Ethan did not rescue just any random dog. He rescued a purebred maltese <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B2M9DHrgtcz/?utm_source=ig_embed">1</a>, his favorite breed. Let me explain why this is so fucked up. So basically, Kill Shelters will take any dog no matter what. But No Kill Shelter reserve the right to deny any dog. No Kill Shelters look at your dog and if your dog is ugly, they will say to your face "I'm sorry, our facility is full at this moment. We're not accepting dogs right now." No one wants to adopt ugly old mutt dogs with missing limbs, they only want to adopt cute perfect purebred puppies. So all the ugly dogs never get adopted or they end up in Kill Shelters because of racist people like Ethan Klein.</p>

<h1>Adpocalypse</h1>
<p>This is a conspiracy theory about Ethan Klein. Here are my primary sources <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/addressing-creator-feedback-and-update/">1</a>,<a aria-hidden="true" href="https://blog.google/intl/en-in/products/platforms/an-update-to-our-harassment-policy/">2</a>. First, here are the facts. In 2019, the CEO of Youtube interviewed 8 youtubers, including Ethan Klein. Susan Wojcicki asked those 8 youtubers "How can I improve youtube?" As a direct result of those meetings, on December 2019, Matt Halprin, who is the vice president of youtube, updated Youtube's Hate Speech policies. Youtube's new and improved Hate Speech policies caused an adpocolypse. An adpocolypse is when millions of videos are demonetized for so called "Hate Speech." Which is why in order to earn a living, many youtubers resort to selling merchandise. There is a list of almost 3,000 demonetized words. For example, if you use the word "allegation," there is a high chance your video will be demonetized <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.insider.com/youtubers-identify-title-words-that-get-videos-demonetized-experiment-2019-10">1</a>. That is the truth. But now here is the conspiracy theory part: When Susan Wojcicki asked "How can I improve Youtube?" I believe Ethan is the only one who replied "I want youtube to be stricter on hate speech." I believe this conspiracy theory because out of all those 8 youtubers Susan Wojcicki interviewed, Ethan is the only one who is passionate about fighting hate speech. Here are the names of the 8 youtubers Susan Wojcicki interviewed. Korea Grandma, Prajakta Koli, Shane Dawson, James Charles, Collins and Devan Key, Ethan and Hila Klein, and Safiya Nygaard. If you read the articles, there is evidence the other youtubers did not ask to fight hate speech, instead they said "I want youtube to stop demonetizing me for copyrighted music when I only play less than 10 second clips of a song." Ethan is not your average celebrity youtuber. What makes Ethan special, is Ethan has the power to directly change our public policies.</p>

<p>Jeff Wittek went to prison for minor drug charges, and David Dobrik constantly made jokes saying "Jeff Wittek is in the italian mafia <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr7Um5Z0N38">1</a>." Jeff Wittek faces constant discrimination due to having a criminal record, and those italian mafia jokes made it worse. Jeff Wittek doesn't want to be known as "the italian criminal," he just wants to be seen as a normal person, he already served his prison time. Everyday Jeff Wittek lives in constant fear of being sent back to prison, especially because all his friends are youtube pranksters which attracts attention from the police. Prison is traumatizing, that's why Jeff Wittek hates those italian mafia jokes.</p>

<p>So finally, Ethan Klein made hours long jokes like "Jeff Wittek is human trafficker, hey fuhgeddaboudit." Jeff Wittek had a mental breakdown and said "I'm going to kill Ethan Klein, I know where he lives <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/0iERMe-x48s?t=504">1</a>, I drove by his house the other day and I stalked his whole family." Ethan replied "If you can't take my italian jokes, then you shouldn't be a youtuber. Stop acting like a beta male. If you have a problem, just sue me. Pussy, you don't have to threaten to kill me or my family. Just sue me bitch." And that's the thing. Ethan Klein was born rich, never had any issues in life, he would just sue everyone. But Jeff Wittek grew up poor, never had lawyers, so early on Jeff learned the only way to solve problems is through violence and intimidation. Ethan hates bullies, but is the biggest bully of them all. And it's just racist everytime Ethan does an italian mobster impersonation, imagine if I did a greedy jew impersonation.<br><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/HN3qR2H4jGY">1</a></p>

<h1>Patrice Wilson wants to kill Ethan.</h1>
<p>Ethan said "Patrice Wilson is a filthy n*gger pedophile who wants to rape innocent white children. I can't wait for the police to kill Patrice Wilson." The only evidence Ethan had is Patrice Wilson is a black man who built a career around children. Mr. Rodgers built a career around children too, but you don't see Ethan accusing Mr. Rodgers of being a pedo, in fact Ethan is a big fan of Mr. Rodgers, because Mr. Rodgers has white privilege.</p>

<p>Due to all the false pedophile allegations Ethan made, suddenly Patrice Wilson's career ended. Patrice fell into a very deep, dark, and suicidal depression. For one year straight, Patrice lived in complete isolation. All Patrice did was stay home alone crying in his bathroom. In order to cope and deconstruct the trauma, Patrice Wilson created a video artwork project titled "666 H3H3." Ethan reacted to Patrice's artwork and said "What a f*cking loser and creep. After all these years, and Patrice Wilson still gives me pedo vibes. Pathetic." So the main reason Ethan believes Patrice Wilson is being creepy is because Patrice suffers from a psychological symptom called Stilted Speech, which means Patrice talks very slow. I edited this audio below (removal of silence), because Patrice talks too slow.</p>

<p>The reason Patrice talks too slow is the same reason Willy Wonka said "Good morning starshine, the Earth says hello." After Willy Wonka's secret formulas were stolen, Willy Wonka fell into a very deep, dark, and suicidal depression. Willy Wonka spent 15 years in complete isolation, and when Willy Wonka finally re-emerged from his man-cave, he nearly forgot how to speak English, that's why he was reading from a script. He heard in a song once "Good morning starshine, the earth says hello" and thought "That must be how humans talk now days." So basically Ethan bullied Patrice Wilson so hard that Patrice even forgot how to speak english, and now that Patrice can't speak english, Ethan bullies him even more.</p>

<p>I will explain the symbolism behind Patrice Wilson's artwork: The cemetary represents the internet death threats Patrice received. The bathroom shower head represents all the days he cried. The 666 represents the satan inside him that wanted to kill Ethan Klein. According to psychologists, the "five stages of grief" includes anger. The long railroad represents when he reaches the light at the end of the railroad he is going to kill himself. Railroads have a long history of being used as a symbol for suicide. For example, in the song "The biggest lie" by Elliott Smith, the lyrics are "I'm waiting for the train, to make everybody late." It means Elliott Smith is waiting for the train, so he can jump in front of it and die, and once he is dead, janitors will clean the blood on the railroad tracks, causing train delays, and whoever was waiting for the train will now be late to work. The song is called "The biggest lie" because Elliott actually told the truth about his suicidal thoughts, but he only says it's a lie because he doesn't want people to feel sorry. The lyrics "You turned white like a saint" Elliott is imagining how his family would react to his suicide; their faces turned white with disbelief.</p>
