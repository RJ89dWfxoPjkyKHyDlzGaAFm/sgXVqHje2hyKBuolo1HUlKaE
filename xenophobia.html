<h1>Minecraft</h1>
<p>The same way Ethan believes grown men should not watch kpop, Ethan also believes grown men should not play minecraft. That explains why Ethan created this video portraying minecraft players as sexual deviants. Ethan believes all grown men who play minecraft or listen to kpop are pedophiles.<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21636&authkey=%21ANyFbmVSexf6oeA" type="video/mp4"></video><br>Source:<a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/0bdC1ig_014?t=438">1</a></p>

<h1>Sexual Harassment</h1>
<p>Due to Ethan's Minecraft video, Ethan was suspended from Youtube on August 11, 2021 for 7 days because Ethan Klein broke Youtube's "bullying and sexual harassment" policy because Ethan simulated having sex with a red puppet <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://poptopic.com.au/news/ethan-klein-simulates-sexual-violence-against-keemstar-in-new-video/">1</a>. The red puppet is based on a real adult man named Daniel Keem. Whenever Ethan hates you, he makes a doll of you and has sex with it on camera to make you feel worthless and weak. Imagine if Ethan owned a doll of a woman like Candace Owens, and Ethan raped it for a "funny video."<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21637&authkey=%21AJnmvm_hQE1X0gU" type="video/mp4"></video><br>Source:<a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/O57888ccAls">1</a><br>On July 4, 2020 Ethan saw this creepy Shane Dawson video. Four months later, suddenly Ethan Klein owns a Daniel Keem puppet. This creepy video literally inspired Ethan.</p>


<h1>Sexism</h1>
<p>Ethan Klein said "It's so sad how society does not take male victims of sexual abuse seriously." Here is Ethan Klein not giving a f*ck about the male victim of sexual abuse Spencer Elden. Spencer Elden is the naked baby on the Nirvana album artwork. Spencer Elden filed a lawsuit claiming to be a male victim of child pornography. Ethan Klein described Spencer Elden's lawsuit as "obviously a cashgrab." Ethan Klein believes Spencer Elden is acting like a victim for financial gain.</p>

<h1>Zach Choi</h1>
<p>Ethan believes grown men should not do ASMR. When Ethan saw a man named Zack Choi doing ASMR, Ethan's first comment was "This guy is a freak. Is he straight?" Why does his sexual orientation matter? Because Ethan thinks all homosexuals are sexual deviants.<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21589&authkey=AKLFfm7GxYP3qe0" type="video/mp4"></video><br>Source:<a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/7OYtxY6d4MU?t=1694">1</a><br>Ethan made it clear on twitter that he thinks it's okay for women to be lesbians; because he enjoys watching lesbian porn <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191008152651/https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1181587708658909184">1</a>, but he thinks its wrong for men to be homosexual.<br>Also, Ethan believes grown men should not watch japanese anime. Ethan believes watching japanese anime..</p>

<h1>Boogie2988</h1>
<p>This is how Ethan reacts when a 43 year old man (boogie2988) is dating a 19 year old woman (Lucy Foxx).</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\boogie.webm"></audio>

<h1>James Charles</h1>
<p>Ethan is so blatantly homophobic that even TikTok deletes Ethan's videos due to homophobia <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ethankleinh3/video/6945220924778040582">2</a>, because Ethan constantly calls James Charles (gay) a pedo <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNBcgcwj3nX/?utm_source=ig_embed">1</a>,<a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNBXhxGDt2y/?utm_source=ig_embed">2</a>. So whenenver a straight man goes after young girls, Ethan congratulates him. But whenever a gay man goes after young boys, Ethan gets extremely angry.</p>

<h1>Bullying - Ian Slater</h1>
<p>Ethan bullies Ian because Ian is too effeminate. Human Resources got involved, and the bullying stopped. Here is Ethan calling Ian "stupid" and Ian felt so sad, he turned off his own microphone.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\ian7.webm"></audio>In one video, Ethan pranked Ian by telling him he is fired, and Ian almost cried on camera <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/-o0H2hp2lyY?t=315">1</a>. Ethan titled a second video "Ethan fires Ian <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdIpixFKcOI">2</a>." Ethan titled a third video "We Replaced Ian With A Robot <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB9KiJJlJL4">3</a>" The joke is that Ian is such a useless employee that his job could easily be replaced with a robot. Ethan constantly plays a voice recoring where Ian said "I gotta pee so bad." The joke is that Ian is such a lazy employee, he hides in the bathroom to avoid doing work. Ethan does not understand why Ian is so sensitive. And that is why Ethan hates Ian. In a different video, Ethan tries to test Ian's masculinity by putting fire on Ian's beard, and immediately Ethan joked about burning and killing Ian <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu1kYYjrh74">4</a>. Here Ethan is going to tell another joke about firing Ian, but he stopped himself because of Human Resources.</p>

<h1>Homphobia - Ian Slater</h1>
<p>Imagine this. You apply for a job. But in order to get hired, you have to prove you're not a homosexual. That's literally what Ethan did to Ian Slater. That explains why Ethan forced Ian to be on a dating show. Here is Ian Slater saying he was happy being single, but then he felt forced into getting a girlfriend like it was a job requirement.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\ian3.webm"></audio>Episode #134, Ian is on a dating show. Episode #149, Ian got a girlfriend. Episode #150, Ian became a full time employee. It was a "prove you're not gay" hiring process.</p>

<p>Episode #178, Ethan and Hila are angry because they feel like Ian does "shticks." In other words, they think Ian is hiding something, like Ian is in the closet. When Hila said "We talk about everything," she is trying to say they've been honest with Ian, and so they expect the same honesty back from Ian.</p>
<audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\ian.webm"></audio>At this point, it seems like Ian is lying about having a girlfriend. Ian claims to have a girlfriend, but whenever Ethan wants to meet Ian's girlfriend, Ian comes up with excuses of why noone is allowed to meet her. Here is Ethan demanding to meet Ian's girlfriend. Ethan said "There's more information than that," because Ethan thinks Ian is hiding something, like Ian is in the closet.</p>

<h1>Final Words</h1>

<p>Ethan says if a man spends too much alone time in his bedroom, that means he is a pedophile. He says there is an epidemic of pedophile youtubers and pedophile tik-tokers. Ethan says everyone on InfoWars is a pedophile. Ethan says if a man thinks everyone around him is a pedophile that means he himself is a pedophile. There is a long list of innocent people Ethan has wrongfully accused them of being pedophiles. Here is a fun fact about Ethan Klein. Ethan posted this photo, and Ethan deleted it because everyone in the comments kept calling Ethan a pedophile.</p>

<p>If you are thinking to yourself "there is nothing sexual about that photo," Ethan posted a photo of himself doing the same pose, and he captioned it "phone sex with my wife." Clearly, Ethan sees this pose as being sexual.</p>
