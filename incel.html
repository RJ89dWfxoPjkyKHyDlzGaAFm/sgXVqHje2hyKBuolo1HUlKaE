<h1>RIP, Incels.me (2017-2018)</h1>
<p>Almost making it to a second year, Incels.me was suspended by the registry on October 15, 2018, without warning, even after doing what the registry asked. They never intended to give them a chance to comply with their ridicuious and unreasonable demands and that&apos;s why they were given them.</p>
<p>I won this website in an auction recently for $205 dollars.</p>
<p>What a great way to spend $205 dollars isn&apos;t it?</p>
<p>I could have done a lot with that money. I could have bought an escort for a hour or invested into a project, but instead I chose to bid on this website and ended up winning. My initial bid was $300 dollars, but I got lucky and got it for less.</p>
<p>One might ask why I would be willing to spend that much on a measly website that is irrelevant. The truth is that I have sentimental value for this website as sappy as that sounds.</p>
<p>This website was my home.</p>
<p>This is where it all began.</p>
<p>A place that took me in after Reddit kicked us off over false happenings.</p>
<p>The first place where I felt a true sense of community.</p>
<p>One of the only places left on the internet where women are disallowed.</p>
<p>A faceless corporation took this place away from us.</p>
<p>A mob of angry mothers, redditors, and journalists took this place away from us, and for what you ask? They didn&apos;t like the speech on the website, they say.</p>
<p>They believed that this site was illegal. For me, it was a place to vent my frustations with this broken society. For them it was place of hatred, misogyny, and racism. They tried their hardest for 2 years to take this place down using any means nessarary:</p>
<p>Abuse complaints to Cloudflare, the domain registrar, and the hosting provider.</p>
<p>Network Attacks</p>
<p>Attempted Hacks</p>
<p>Smears of this Website in the News</p>
<p>It took almost 2 years for them to get any legitimate results using their unethical tactics.The domain was suspended.</p>
<p>Yet another home taken away from us with no real reason...</p>
<p>&nbsp;...but we persisted and it made us stronger than ever.</p>
<p>They can&apos;t understand that deplatforming never works. Yet they continue to try to this day. They can&apos;t understand that we grew stronger from the suspension of our domain name. They thought they have weakened us, but just a few hours later we were back under a new domain name. Our website grew stronger. Our members came back. We got more members because of it. This is something that many can&apos;t understand</p>
<p>We were back and there was nothing they could do about it. You can take down countless subreddits, websites, or domains, but you can&apos;t kill an idea.</p>
<p>Join me in laughing at the now dated and irrelevant news articles reporting on the suspension of this website.</p>
