<p>On this page I attempt to summarize the book titled Origin of Race and Civilization by Charles Weisman. This profound book is about the Christian Identity movement. Through this summary you will learn that World War II was not caused by racism, rather it was caused by Christianty. The following are not my own beliefs, but are the beliefs described in the book:</p>

<p>Genesis 5 says "This is the book of the generations of Adam." Therefore, the entire Bible is about Adam's descendants who are known as the Adamic race. Genesis 1:27 says "God created man in His own image." The hebrew bible word "image" is TSELEM that literally means "shades." Therefore, Genesis 1:27 should be interpreted as "God created man in His own shade." Throughout the Bible, lightness symbolizes godliness, and darkness symbolizes the devil. Therefore, the Adamic race is white skinned. The hebrew bible word "ADAM" literally means "ruddy human being" also known as blushing. Africans have too much melanin, Asians have too much carotene, Europeans have the most noticeable blush. Therefore, the Adamic race are White Europeans.</p>
