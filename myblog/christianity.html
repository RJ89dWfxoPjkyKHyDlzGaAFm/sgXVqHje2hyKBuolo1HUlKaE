<p>On this page I attempt to summarize the book titled Origin of Race and Civilization by Charles Weisman. This profound book is about the Christian Identity movement. Through this summary you will learn that World War II was not caused by racism, rather it was caused by Christianity. The following are not my own beliefs, but are the beliefs described in the book:</p>

<p>Genesis 5 says "This is the book of the generations of Adam." Therefore, the entire Bible is strictly about Adam's descendants who are known as the Adamic race. Genesis 1:27 says "God created man in His own image." The hebrew bible word "image" is TSELEM that literally means "shades." Therefore, Genesis 1:27 should be interpreted as "God created man in His own shade." Throughout the Bible, lightness symbolizes God, darkness symbolizes Satan. Therefore, the Adamic race is white skinned. The hebrew bible word "ADAM" literally means "ruddy human" also known as blushing. African skin contains high melanin, Asian skin contains high carotene, European skin contains low melanin & low carotene, this equates to Europeans having the most noticeable blush. Therefore, the Adamic race are White Europeans.</p>

<p>The Bible follows Adam's lineage from Adam to Israel, and God sent a prophecy to the "Sons of Israel" in Amos 3:2 "You only have I known among all the families of the earth; Therefore I will punish you for all your wrongdoing." This means the entire heaven, hell, and paradise only effects Israel's lineage.</p>

<p>To be continued...</p>
