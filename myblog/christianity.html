<p>On this page I attempt to summarize the book titled Origin of Race and Civilization by Charles Weisman. This profound book is about the Christian Identity movement. Through this summary you will learn that World War II was not caused by racism, rather it was caused by Christianity. The following are not my own beliefs, but are the beliefs described in the book:</p>

<p>Genesis 5 says "This is the book of the generations of Adam." Therefore, the entire Bible is strictly about Adam's descendants who are known as the Adamic race. Genesis 1:27 says "God created man in His own image." The hebrew bible word "image" is TSELEM that literally means "shades." Therefore, Genesis 1:27 should be interpreted as "God created man in His own shade." Throughout the Bible, lightness symbolizes God, darkness symbolizes Satan. Therefore, the Adamic race is white skinned. The hebrew bible word "ADAM" literally means "ruddy human" also known as blushing. African skin contains high melanin, Asian skin contains high carotene, European skin contains low melanin & low carotene, this equates to Europeans having the most noticeable blush. Therefore, the Adamic race are White Europeans.</p>

<p>The Bible follows Adam's lineage from Adam to Israel, and God sent a prophecy for the "Sons of Israel" in Amos 3:2 "You only have I known among all the families of the earth; Therefore I will punish you for all your wrongdoing." This means the entire heaven, hell, salvation, and paradise only effects Israel's lineage.</p>

<p>God told David "I have sworn to My servant David, I will establish your descendants forever." This means the Adamic race shall never perish from the Earth. God announced in Isaiah 51:1-2 "Look to the rock from which you were cut, and to the quarry from which you were dug. Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who gave birth to you in pain." This means love and be loyal to your own race.</p>

<p>God announced in Deuteronomy 7 "into the land where you are entering to take possession of it, [..] you shall utterly destroy them. You shall not make a covenant with them nor be gracious to them. Furthermore, you shall not intermarry with them. [..] you shall tear down their altars, smash their memorial stones, cut their Asherim to pieces, and burn their carved images in the fire." This means the Adamic race will conquer the Earth, remain racially pure, and never be indoctrinated by those other races.</p>

<p>God announced in Deuteronomy 23:2 "No one of illegitimate birth may enter the assembly of the Lord; none of his descendants, even to the tenth generation, may enter the assembly of the Lord." The Hebrew bible word "illegitimate" is MAMZER that literally means "a mongrel." God announced in Ezra 10:11 "separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives." All this means God wants the Adamic race to remain racially pure, and racial segregation is God's law.</p>

<p>God announced in Matthew 13:24-30 a parable that basically says all mongrels will burn in hell, but only the most racially pure adamic descendants will be accepted into God's kingdom. God announced in Lev. 19:19 "You shall not cross-breed two kinds of your cattle; you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed." This means it is immoral to hybridize plants, animals, and humans.</p>
