<h1>Before The Party</h1>
<p>Before the party, I was hearing very bad rumors about my sister. These are the specific rumors I heard. These things definitely happened, but I wasn't there, I only heard about it through my other relatives.</p>

<p>Rumor #1: My gay cousin used a washable crayola marker to drew a mustache and unibrow on my sister's 6 year old son's face. The 6 year old said "Look mommy, I have a mustache and unibrow with markers." In that very instant, my sister screamed and repeatedly punched her 6 year old son, she also punched my gay cousin. It was a dramatic scene. The reason my sister did this, is my sister was afraid that one day her 6 year old son might become like his cholo biological father whose face is covered with real gang tattoos. And the most ironic part, is my sister and her new boyfriend each have tattoos on themselves.</p>

<p>Rumor #2: My sister wanted her 6 year old son to have piano lessons. The 6 year old son did not want to go, he started crying. So then my sister screamed and repeatedly punched her 6 year old son. It was a dramatic scene. I was told that my sister didn't hold back, she beat him up like a grown man.</p>

<p>Rumor #3: My sister's friend said "I don't want this dog anymore. Take it from me, or else I will send him to a shelter." My sister replied "Oh I love dogs. This dog will be great for my sons, it will teach my sons about life." I was told that my sister neglected this dog, so the dog ran away, got ran over, and died.</p>

<p>Rumor #4: I was told that my sister was planning on breeding dogs.</p>  


<h1>During the Party</h1>
<p>I was at a family party event with loud music and alcohol. I hadn't spoken to my sister in years, I only heard the aformentioned rumors about my sister. Naturally, I hated my sister because of those rumors. But I wanted to give her a chance. I observed my sister's personality. At the party, my sister said "I had two surgeries, I had my gallbladder and appendix removed." I hated my sister even more now, like why does she have children if she is so unhealthy. But whatever. I met my sister's boyfriend for the first time at this party. Immediately, it was so obvious my sister's boyfriend was an alcoholic. We started talking about politics and philosophy. And this was the exact moment I realized I hated my sister and her boyfriend. Because they literally said "I hate white people. White people ruined El Salvador. I hate police. Rodney King was a victim." I rolled my eyes, because literally my sister beats up her own son, but she is more worried about this black man she has never even met before. I condescendingly asked my sister's boyfriend "So are you addicted to alcohol?" He replied "No. I am not an alcoholic. I rarely drink alcohol. It's just that you only meet me during holidays and family parties such as this one where it is normal to drink alcohol." He was such a moron, he didn't remember this was my first time meeting him. We started talking about genetics, and he said "Alcoholism is not in your genetics. Alcoholism is a weak mindset. I can quit whenever I want. I just don't want to. It's all about your willpower and mindset." I rolled my eyes and asked "Do you think gay people choose to be gay?" He replied "I could be gay if I wanted to. I just don't want to." Then he said "My friend hacks internet modems, I get the fastest internet for free." I rolled my eyes again. Everything he does is illegal, as you will soon learn.</p>  



<h1>Scruff</h1>

<h1>Dog Breeding</h1>
<p>My sister already has two children, and she says "I wish I could have more children. But I just can't anymore because giving birth is so stressful to my body. But I just love children. I feel like a home without children is depressing." The irony is, my sister was breeding French Bulldogs. Literally, every 6 months my sister forced this female dog to be pregnant. Then they would give this dog Ceasarean section.</p>


<h1>Ada</h1>
<p>The primary dog my sister owned is named Ada. In the beginning, Ada would run away very often, and be lost for a couple hours. Ada ran away very often because my sister's fence was broke for 2 months, and when they finally repaired it, people would forget to close it. One time Ada ran away for a whole week, until someone returned her. One time Ada ran away for an entire month, then she came back pregnant. The people who returned her said "We saw this beautiful dog. We got her pregnant. We were planning on selling the puppies until we saw the lost dog signs on the street. Then we felt sorry because this dog had a family." Ada got pregnant a bunch of times. My sister had an entire instagram for attracting customers. My sister's primary customers were wealthy hipster libtards who lived in San Francisco, where there are more dogs than children <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/san-francisco-may-have-more-dogs-than-children-heres-why">[2]</a>. My sister did everything illegally, she had no permit to breed dogs, and she sold dogs under 8 weeks old, she breeded the same dog twice in one year. I twice reported my sister to the animal control. 

<p>Demise of Ada</h1>
<p>So the reason my sister's fence broke was because of the strong Santa Ana winds in California. One day, it was windy and I saw Ada was shivering in my sister's backyard. I told my relatives that Ada was shivering and literally noone cared. My sister's boyfriend said "I will purchase a cardboard box from homedepot to protect her from the wind. Dogs are filthy animals, they belong outdoors." He never purchased any carboard box. The next week, I saw Ada shivering outside again. Finally, the animal control went to my sister's house, they got one legal warning. My sister temporarily stopped breeding dogs. She is planning to breed dogs again in a different state where the laws are different. In the end, Ada became useless to my sister, so they neglected her. In the end, Ada was severely infested and balding with mange mites. My sister's house is disgusting, so they buy chemicals from Mexico that is supposed to kill mice. Ada ate one of those </p>

<h1>Animal Abuse</h1>
<p>One time I saw my sister's 7 year old son punching one of their dogs, he was punching the dog really hard and yelling in the dog's ear "Go in the house! Go in the house!" Then I asked him why did he do that, and he said "Dogs don't feel anything." Hmm I wonder where did he learn how to punch dogs? My aunt told me that my sister and her boyfriend punch and kick their dogs whenever the dogs are misbehaving.




My oppressed relatives said that the white neighborhood Target stores sell better clothing styles. However, I honestly believe my oppressed relatives avoid shopping in poor neighborhoods because they are disgusted by poor black people. They hate seeing people shopping in their pajamas, crackheads, the rude cashiers, the awful customer service, and disorganized isles.  That's why I don't shop at Walmart." My gay cousin told me "I don't shop at Walmart because the people who shop at Walmart are wretched."</p>

<p>Me, I am openly racist, but I feel at peace in ghetto neighborhoods, like I can finally be myself. For example, in a specific dollar store I have been, that is located in a low-income neighborhood, there is a cashier black woman who is always in a bad mood, she has a visible mental disorder. She is always yelling at all the customers. She yelled at me personally, she said "Next! Next! I said next! Hurry up! Do you want a bag? I said do you want a bag or not? Stop mumbling, speak louder. Here's your change, take it! Take your change already, you're too slow, hurry up! Next!" All day long she is yelling at customers. And it made me feel like I don't have to be perfect, because this bipolar woman is far from perfect, but she works harder than any person I've ever encountered. And every once in a while, her mood suddenly changes, and she suddenly becomes very happy. She said In rich white neighborhoods, rich white libtards are always looking at my clothes and feeling sorry for me just because I am mexican, these white libtards try so hard to not be racist, they don't realize feeling sorry for someone because of a skin color is condescending and racist. 
And the disorganized isles, I've never had an issue finding what I need, because I am not looking for useless things. The only disorganized isles are the clothing isles, everyone is obsessed about clothes. </p>

<p>My sister and her boyfriend, they have an entire shed filled with tools, everday there are opened and unopened amazon boxes on their living room couch, they have piles and piles of clothes and shoes, all of them are branded, they are obsessed with brands. They have two children, and they are obsessed with putting nice clothes on their children, like they are insecure. One time their 6 year old wanted light up sketcher shoes, and my sister and her boyfriend told him "Ew, those are ugly. Buy yourself some Nike or Adidas. Look at these other ones, these other ones are nice." Ever since then, I noticed their son has been obsessed with clothing too. It's so sad, he always wanted cartoon clothing, now he his obsessed with being cool, because his parents told him his style is ugly.</p>
