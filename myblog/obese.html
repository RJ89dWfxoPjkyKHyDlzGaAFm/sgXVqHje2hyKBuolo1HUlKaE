<p>Cardiovascular disease is responsible for 32% of all deaths worldwide. The World Health Organization said 17.9 million people die from cardiovascular disease worldwide per year <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases">1</a>,</span> and 80% of those deaths is preventable <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.heart.org/en/get-involved/advocate/federal-priorities/cdc-prevention-programs">2</a>.</span> Junk food and obesity are the greatest risk factors. We are issuing a government emergency mandate due to the current and deadly pandemic of cardiovascular disease. No more restaurants. No more food which tastes good. All food shall taste bland. Everyone must only eat/drink Soylent until further notice. In order to flatten the curve, everyone is required to maintain a healthy Body Mass Index. If your BMI is 25 or higher, you shall receive free FDA approved Orlistat weight loss pills. If your BMI is 40 or higher, you shall receive free gastric bypass surgery. According to doctor Peter F. Rovito <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bariatric-surgery-source.com/gastric-bypass-surgery-deaths.html">9</a></span>, gastric bypass surgery has a 99.8% survival rate. He says you are more likely to die if you do not receive the surgery. So I don't want to hear any complaints about side-effects. The only side effect of Orlistat is steatorrhea, in other words, literally gallons of oil will leak out of your anus. If you refuse to take Orlistat or bypass surgery, then you are not allowed hospital treatment, and you are not allowed to purchase food anywhere at all. If you are visibly fat in public, you will be asked to go home until you fix your despicable lifestyle. It is illegal to create fat pride parades. Parents who raise fat children shall be imprisoned for child abuse. Fat people are not be allowed to receive unemployment money. If you're fat, that means you have excess money to spend on food.

<br><br>Our research shows Orlisat and bypass surgery are the only scienifically proven weight loss methods. You will go to prison if you are caught selling/promoting non-FDA approved weight loss methods. Liposuction is not FDA approved. Liposuction is a cosmetic surgery which does not provide any health benefits. If you are caught doing liposuction, you will go to prison. Diet and excercise is not FDA approved. Our research shows 95% of people who lose weight through diet and excercise <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/25/health/95-regain-lost-weight-or-do-they.html">6</a></span>, will eventually regain their weight back. Low-carb diet is a dangerous conpiracy theory, because it promotes eating meat, butter, and coconut oil. Our research shows saturated fat from meat, butter, and coconut oil directly causes cardiovascular disease. Our research shows carbohydrates form the foundation of a healthy diet called the USDA Food Pyramid, which says you should mostly eat simple sugar from fruits, and complex carbs from whole grains. If you are caught promoting low-carb diet, you will go to prison. If you are caught advertising gyms to fat people, you will be banned from social media and your gym will be permanently shut down. Excercise is only meant for normalweight people. If you are caught promoting weightloss through yoga, prayer healing, witchcraft, etc, you will go to prison.
<br><br>The greatest threat to homeland security are fat supremacists who are often seen holding signs saying "It's okay to be fat." Science proved fat supremacy is a deadly philosophy. The real truth is nobody is born fat. There is no fat gene. Everyone is born equal at birth. Fat is a choice caused by laziness, and being subjected through too much fat supremacy propaganda. Such content which promotes fat supremacy should be banned to protect the public's health. Fat supremacists often believe in violent rhetoric such as "This country was founded upon McDonalds," "It is our constitutional right to be obese," "Obesity has a 99% survival rate," "Normal weights die from heart disease too," and "Only old people are dying from heart disease." Fat supremacy is causing a rise in hate crimes against underweight people.

<br><br>During the 1500s, fat supremacists enslaved a country of underweight people. Fat supremacists ate all the food, meanwhile underweight slaves were so underweight that they were starving to death in order to feed fat people. Fat supremacists literally killed and tortured those few underweight people who attempted to become fat. Eventually, normal weights went to war against fat supremacists which resulted in the abolishment of underweight slavery. Today, underweight people are oppressed in education, housing, healthcare, and employment because there is a perception that underweight people are stupid because supposedly their brain is lacking nutrients, and fat people are smarter because supposedly their brain has an excess of nutrients. They say skinny people and fat people are a different species. They say whenever an underweight person tries to be fat, they usually go back to being underweight, and vice versa. They say bodyweight is caused by genetics. They say everyone is born with a certain amount of appetite. All of that nonsense was proven to be pseudoscience. The truth is everyone is born with the same amount of appetite, and your bodyweight is your choice. Today, fat people have fat privileges which prevents underweight people from having access to food, and that is why underweights are perpetually underweight. Research shows the vast majority of food is owned by fat people. Some underweight people feel so oppressed, they feel like they will never be a normal weight, and they give up. That's why it is so important for underweight people to have access to welfare, self-help books, mental-health practitioners, and representation on television.</p>
