<h1>Salatiel</h1>
<p>When I was an adult, one time my drunk sister and drunk mother were arguing. My drunk sister cried "Salatiel raped me. You knew about it. You did nothing to help me. That is why my life is f**ked up." My drunk mother cried "No, he did not. You were on drugs. It was gang related. Salatiel was in a rival gang against your exboyfriend Miguel." My drunk sister cried "You're still in denial mom. Salatiel raped me. It's the truth."</p>

<p>When I was an adult, one time my sober mother asked me "Jovanny, now that you know what Salatiel did to your sister, I know you visited him a lot as kid, I just want to ask you, did Salatiel or anyone do something like that to you?" I truthfully replied "No." I asked my mother "What happened to Salatiel?" My mother replied "I never reported him to the police, because I was in denial. Eventually, Salatiel was arrested for drug offenses, he was released, then he went to Mexico."</p>

<p>I am having a flashback of when I was a kid, one time my father left me and my sister at Salatiel's house. Salatiel was an old school salvadorian gangmember with tattoos and shaved head. Salatiel owned a chrome lowrider bicycle with long handles. Salatiel told me "Here are my gameboy cartridges. They are yours now. And this one is called a rubik's cube. You have to make each side one color. Are you smart enough to solve it?" I sat on the sofa, waiting for my father to return, Salatiel and my sister dissapeared into a bedroom.</p>

<p>I am having a flashback of when I was a kid, one time my mother drove me to a skyscraper. I was alone in a room with a pale white woman. The woman asked me "Do you ever feel hungry?" I replied "Yeah, I like to eat potato chips." The woman laughed and replied "Do you have a refrigerator in your home? If I went to your home and opened the refrigerator, would there be food in there?" I replied "Yeah, that is how refrigerators are designed." Eventually, the woman asked "Do you know who is Salatiel? Does that sound familiar?"</p>

<p>When I was an adult, I asked my father about Salatiel, and my father replied "I don't blame myself for what Salatiel did. It wasn't my fault. There were no other options for me, I had to work, I needed someone to supervise both of you."</p>
