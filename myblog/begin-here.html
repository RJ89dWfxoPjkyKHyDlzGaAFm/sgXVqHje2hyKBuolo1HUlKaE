<p>Everything that you read on my website is my attempt to propagandize you into believing in Atheism and Predeterminism.</p>

<p>My favorite atheism quote is by Thomas Edison "He also made the fish I catch and eat. And where do His mercy, kindness, and love for that fish come in? <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="../thomasedison.html">[1]</a>"</span></p>

<p>My favorite Predeterminism evidence is Benjamin Libet's experiment <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/lmI7NnMqwLQ?t=838">[2]</a>.</span> It is not a camera trick. Scientists around the world verified this experiment as being very real and credible. The argument is not if the experiment is real, rather the argument is what does the experiment mean. Interestingly, Benjamin Libet himself believed his experiment proved the existence of Free-Won't. In my opionion, Free-Won't is incorrect. Only humans with a sufficiently formed frontal lobe have the ability to deny their impulses. The 3 types of Wills are Free-Will, Free-Won't, and Predeterminism. Here are examples of each based on homosexuality. And simply replace "homosexuality" with anything such as "overeating, depression, laziness, criminality."</p>

<p>Free-Will: I made the educated decision to be straight. There is no such thing as a gay gene. Gay is a choice.</p>

<p>Free-Won't: I acknowledge there are biological mechanisms that make certain humans more likely to do homosexual acts. As humans, we can't control our sexual emotions, but we have complete control over our sexual behavior. A straight person who denies the impulse to be straight can certainly do homosexual acts. The human spirit allows us to deny the impulses of the human flesh, and so we control our own destiny.</p>

<p>Predeterminism: The universe is not infinite. We know the universe is 13.8 billion years old. We know the universe's size is 93 billion light years in diameter. If we acknowledge the exact position and momentum of every particle in this universe, then we could predict any past, present, and future event with 100% certainty. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle suggests it might be impossible to know the exact position and momentum of a particle, however Albert Einstein responded "God does not play dice with the universe." That quote means quantum mechanics is seemingly random, but somewhere in that randomness there is a math equation we haven't realized yet. Albert Einstein changed his quote to "God tirelessly plays dice under laws which he has himself prescribed <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.livescience.com/65697-einstein-letters-quantum-physics.html">[3]</a>."</span> This updated quote means there is a math equation within quantum mechanics that only God himself is capable of understanding, and mortal humans may never be able to reverse engineer it. Thomas Edison said "it is the cells which seem to have the intelligence." Human consciousness is electricity. The electricity controls the human consciousness, but we can't control the electricity. Life is like a book written in a language called mathematics, every character believes they can alter certain events, but no matter what each character says, does, or believes, they are destined to behave exactly as the book is written. Think about your favorite movie, no matter how many times you watch it over and over, it always ends the same though each character seems oblivious. Whether you seemingly decide to be gay or not be gay, it is meant to be that way, and no one knows why. If you believe in God, it means God doesn't make mistakes, He had a plan from the very beginning, perhaps we are here to be taught a lesson. Albert Einstein said "Everything is determined, the beginning as well as the end, by forces over which we have no control <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Einstein/gchgl_XLqI0C?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=Everything%20is%20determined%2C&pg=PT477&printsec=frontcover">[4]</a>."</span></p>

<p>I noticed that every political argument is always fundamentally about Free-Will and God.</p>

<p>The meaning of life is humanity is supposed to technologically evolve until we invent a machine that will one day destroy the entire universe. By destroying the universe, we end all suffering <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/solve-suffering-by-blowing-up-the-universe-the-dubious-philosophy-of-human-extinction-149331">[5]</a>.</span> It is not enough to destroy our own planet, because there might be other animals suffering on another galaxy. Hopefully, we are not going to destroy the universe with an explosion, but rather we will exploit some scientific property of the universe. Elon Musk and Sam Altman refer to this as an exiting of the "simulation." Although, I don't believe in the simulation hypothesis.</p>

<p>I seek to prove to you that all humans are NOT equal. And because humans are NOT equal, it is immoral to have a capitalism society. Whites have an unfair advantage in this economy, and it is NOT because of "systemic racism." The only "white privilege" is the fact whites are genetically more intelligent. Intelligence and morality are not correlated. If someone is intelligent, that does not automatically make them a "good" human. In fact, many intelligent humans are psychopaths, and the most intelligent psychopaths are the most dangerous of all.</p>
