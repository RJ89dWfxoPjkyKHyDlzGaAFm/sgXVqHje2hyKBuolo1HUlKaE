<p>Everything that you read on my website is my attempt to propagandize you into believin in Atheism and Predeterminism.</p>

<p>My favorite atheism quote is by Thomas Edison "He also made the fish I catch and eat. And where do His mercy, kindness, and love for that fish come in? <a target="_blank" aria-hidden="true" href="../thomasedison.html">[1]</a>"</p>

<p>My favorite Predeterminism evidence is Benjamin Libet's experiment. It is not a camera trick. Scientists around the world verified this experiment as being very real and credible. The argument is not if the experiment is real, rather the argument is what does the experiment mean. Interestingly, Benjamin Libet himself believed his experiment proved the existence of Free-Won't. In my opionion, Free-Won't is incorrect. Only humans with a sufficiently formed frontal lobe have the ability to deny their impulses. The 3 types of Wills are Free-Will, Free-Won't, and Predeterminism. Here are examples of each based on homosexuality. And simply replace "homosexuality" with anything such as "overeating, depression, laziness, criminality."</p>

<p>Free-Will: I made the educated decision to be straight. There is no such thing as a gay gene. Gay is a choice.</p>

<p>Free-Won't: I acknowledge there are biological mechanisms that make certain humans more likely to do homosexual acts. As humans, we can't control our sexual emotions, but we have complete control over our sexual behavior. A straight person who denies the impulse to be straight can certainly do homosexual acts. The human spirit allows us to deny the impulses of the human flesh, and so we control our own destiny.</p>

<p>Predeterminism: The universe is not inifinite. We know the universe is 13.8 billion years old. We know the universe's size is 93 billion light years in diameter. The universe seems random to us, but that is only because our brain cannot comprehend it. For example, a coin flip may seem random, but if we only knew the exact pressure and velocity of every molecule in this universe, we could predict whether it will land head or tails with 100% certainty. Human consciousness is merely electricity. The electricity controls the human consciousness, but we can't control the electricity. Life is like a book written in a language called math, every character believes they can alter certain events, but no matter what each character says, does, or believes, they behave exactly like the book is written. Think about your favorite film, no matter how many times you watch it over and over, it always ends the same though the characters seem oblivious. Whether you seemingly decide to be gay or not be gay, it is meant to be that way, and no one knows why, perhaps that is God's plan.</p>

<p>I noticed that every political argument is always fundamentally about Free-Will and God.</p>
