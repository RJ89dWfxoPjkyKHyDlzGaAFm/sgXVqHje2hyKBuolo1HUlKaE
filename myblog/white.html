<h1>White Neighbors</h1>
<p>I was just a kid, one summer when my only friend was my white neighbor who was around my same age. I had an inflatable swimming pool, so me and my white neighbor would just swim in it. One time me and him were on a computer, and he said "Hold on my friend told me about a website." Then he typed something, and next thing there was a video of a woman sexily removing her thong bikini, the woman turned around, and suddenly it was revealed this was not a woman at all, it had been a man wearing a bikini the entire time! My neighbor was staring attentively at the video, but then suddenly when he realized it was man, he slammed every key on the keyboard, until his senses came back, he properly exited the browser. He took me aside and told me "Listen man, I had no idea my friend was playing a prank on us. Let's just forget about it. Let's do something else, let's go outside or something."</p>

<p>When I went to my white neighbor's house, I realized his parents were former methamphetamine drug addicts. His mother smoked cigarettes indoors, his father was always in a jolly mood. The first time I met my neighbor's father, his father introduced himself by singing about how much he loves his son, and how proud he is to be a father. Yeah, he wasn't a good singer, he simply had so much ecstasy, it compelled him to sing. His parents told me they were addicted to methamphetamine, but they quit because they wanted to give their son a better life.</p>

<p>There was just one problem with my white neighbor. He always slapped me on my back, and called me "a mexican." When he first introduced me to his mother, he said "Look what I have here mom, I have here a real mexican!" That was when he slapped me so hard on my back that it probably left a red mark on me. His mother replied "Oh, don't call him that! He is a human! And don't slap his back like that!" My white friend replied "Mom he doesn't feel it. Look at his face. He has no reaction." About every hour, he slapped me really hard on my back. And the sad part is, he was right. Something was wrong with me. I was mentally retarded at that age. I was just a kid, I had so much natural adrenaline that it made me unable to feel the pain of him slapping me.

<h1>Mental Retarded</h1> 
<p>All my shirts had neck holes because I chewed on my shirts constantly. I had real tourettes syndrome, bonafide, I was making vocal noises. I was constantly chewing on my knucles, and literally pulling my hair out. I had a bald spot on my head because I was twisting hair knots there. One kid made fun of me because I was twisting my hair, he said "Why are you doing that to your hair? Just stop it, look this is you" then he made an exaggerated impression of me. Everyone on the table laughed. One kid replied "I noticed him doing that, I just never said anything about it." A different kid replied "Please, don't make fun of him for that. You can tell he does it unwittingly." That kid who defended me was the one kid who never had cavities and got the highest reading score. Then, a different kid replied "Yeah, don't make fun of him. You can tell he has a sickness. I mean just look at his bald spot!" Then the entire table bursted out laughing at my bald spot. The original kid who made fun of me said "He really does have a bald spot, that's insane!" I had one tourettes thing where I pressed my upper lip to my nose, and one girl said "Did you just blow a kiss at me?" And so I just learned how to switch my tourettes to a different thing.  

and in order for me to sleep, I had to bang my head and feet on my pillow about 100 times just to relax myself.</p>
