<h1>Banned For Misogyny</h1>
<p><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7086113528842784046">https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7086113528842784046</a></span><br>I was watching @kateao4's Tik-Tok video titled "How to test a man's protection abilities" and in that video she said "If you want to know if your man is husband material, throw an object at him, if he catches it, that means he has good reflexes, and good genes." And then I thought to myself "Wow she is a really good internet troll. I'm going to troll her back." So I left this comment on her video "Throwing objects at men is domestic violence. Tik-Tok moderators, do your thing." And she immediately blocked me! So I created a new Tik-Tok profile, and I watched her old videos, I was searching for clues on why she blocked me. I found her videos titled "I can pepper spray him <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7083575189719616814">1</a></span>" and "I feel like punching men <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7081310606191611178">2</a></span>" and "How to gaslight men <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7086109036017487147">3</a></span>." Suddenly I realized this b*tch is crazy, she's not an internet troll, those are her genuine beliefs.</p>

<h1>Cinderella Complex</h1>
<p>Her definition of gender equality is we all must obey our traditional gender roles like she wants everyone to live in the movie Cinderella. She has scientific research to backup her Cinderella fantasy. She said "It's scientifically proven, men are happiest when they are protecting women. If you want to make a man fall in love with you, act afraid during a scary movie, and when he hugs you, he will feel like he is protecting you <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7067616961349373230">1</a></span>." Bitch that's literally what the slaves were taught "Blacks are happiest when they are serving the white race, by serving us, they are serving God." She thinks I'm supposed to bow down and worship women, that's why she blocked me, because I disobeyed God's laws. You can watch her God Tik-Tok where she says "God says I'm allowed to wear leggings and skirts. You must respect my decision, or else you are disobeying God <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7086872634763349290">1</a>." You can watch her homophobic Tik-tok "I support LGBT, because gays invented monogamy <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/6946713318405065990">1</a></span>. I hate men who have multiple wives." WTF. She is anti-polyamory.</p>

<h1>Alpha Women - Toxic Femininity</h1>
<p>In one video, she said "It's impossible to be sexist against men <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7075419240802569518">1</a>. Misandry does not exist. All men have male privilege." In the next video, she said "If a woman hits her boyfriend, most likely she was a victim of emotional abuse, and therefore I support women's rights to hit their boyfriends. In fact, I like to hit my own boyfriend just for fun, because male and female bodies are built differently, so I'm allowed to hit my boyfriend, but he's not allowed to hit me back <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7081310606191611178">1</a>." In the next video, she said "There is never an excuse for a man to hit a woman. Nothing justifies it. Nothing." In the next video, she said "If a man cheats on you, I'll pin him down for you, while you chop off his d*ck." 

<p>In the next video, she said "When a man truly loves you, he will move mountains to be with you. Women should not chase men. Men must do the chasing <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7081756221035973934">1</a>." In the next video, she said "If a woman rejects you, get the f*ck out. Women don't owe you sh*t." In one video, she said "If you are mentally unstable, your boyfriend should accept you for who you are, and be your emotional support <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7075776157827730730">1</a>." In the next video, she said "If he's acting mentally unstable, dump him, you're not his therapist, charge him for your service <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7083185602589478190">1</a>." And then she said "Your boyfriend should be at the gym sculpting his mind and body so he can fight off a bear for you. If your boyfriend is not willing to die for you, dump him." She said "Only women are allowed to approach me in public. Men are not allowed, or else I will report you for sexual assault <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7085487951546731818">1</a>." So I'm supposed to move mountains, kill myself, and be an emotional support for women, and all I get in return is a used p*ssy.</p>

<p>Finally, she said "Men must follow the sidewalk rule. If he doesn't know about the sidewalk rule, dump him, he's toxic, uneducated, and immature." One user replied "Fun Fact: The sidewalk rule began in victorian england, so that carriages wouldn't splash mud on the lady! üòç"<br><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/3ziikUYi03I">https://youtu.be/3ziikUYi03I</a></span><br>I'm being holocausted because of my gender...</p>

<h1>My Coming Out Story</h1>
<p>So that's why now I identify as a non-binary gender fluid person. I believe men and women are equal. I believe if a woman hits a man, he is allowed to defend himself. I'm sick and tired of society telling me I'm a f*ggot because I'm not a tall muscular lumberjack. Everyday women are asking me "Can you hang this picture frame for me? Can you change the oil of my car? Can you repair my concrete? Can you build me a shed? Can you install tiles?" B*tch I don't know how to do any of those f*cking things. Just cause I'm a man don't make me a construction worker. Bitch, you are assuming my gender identity!</p>

<p>So apparently I'm a mysogynist because I leave "rude" comments like "Tik-Tok moderators, do your thing." Bitch, I don't go around telling men "Wow you look handsome, nice cock!" So why the f*ck would I tell women "Wow you have a beautiful face and body!" I treat men and women equally. I'm not going to be nicer to you just cause you're a girl. I'm tired of women acting like they're so fragile. If a man gets shot to death, they always ask "Well what was he wearing? Was he wearing baggy pants? Did he have tattoos? Did he have a job? How were his grades in high school? Ah, you see that's what he gets for being lazy and retarded."</p>

<h1>TERF</h1>
<p class="four">@kateao4 is not a real feminist. She is a Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist (TERF). A normal feminist preaches "You don't need a man to be happy." A TERF preaches "You do need a man to be happy. This need was created by science, evolution, and God." A normal feminist preaches "We need to normalize teaching boys to play with dolls and express their emotions. It's okay for boys to cry. It's okay for girls to ride skateboards." A TERF preaches "Men and women should not switch gender roles, or else bad things will happen." For example, @kateao4 said "Crime is caused when men are too emotional. Real masculinity is when a man has mastered the art of controlling his emotions. <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7087273679171669294">1</a></span>" In other words, real men don't cry.</p>

<p><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ninja.mommy/video/6938473679030324486">https://www.tiktok.com/@ninja.mommy/video/6938473679030324486</a></span><br>Another TERF is @ninja.mommy who said "Men and women do not have equal abilities. Each gender has their strength and weaknesses. We are polar opposites, ying & yang, designed to compliment each other. Think equity, not equality." In other words, never send a woman to do a man's job; and vice versa.</p> 

<p class="three">"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." Quote by Karl Marx</p>

<p>Another TERF is Candace Owens who said <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/yxNTcMsULuY?t=300">1</a> "Will Smith is acting like a woman, that's why he can't sexually satisfy Jada Pinkett's primal urge to be dominated. So that's why Jada Pinkett cheated on Will Smith. Hollywood has a transgender agenda. In fact, GI Jane is a movie about a woman who behaves like a man. Will Smith's son Jaden Smith is a cross dresser. We must stop this madness, and fight the gay-pedophile-satanic elites who are trying to destroy the nuclear family unit. The nuclear family unit is the basis of civilization, if you destroy the nuclear family, you destroy civilization."</p>

<p>The nuclear family unit basically means you have to move out of your parent's house, get married, purchase a home in suburbia, and raise a family by age 25, or else you are a failure, and if you get divorced you are also a failure. The scientist Jordan Peterson is a TERF who wants to make sex-before-marriage illegal, and divorcing illegal, with his theory called "Enforced Monogamy." His theories are backed by science, evolution, and God.</p>

<p>The most extreme form of TERF idealogy comes the author of "Hard Times Create Strong Men" Stefan Aarnio who said <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/mt7XVqkrFKg">1</a> "Women are hardwired for hypergamy. Biologically, women have high standards, they only wants to date high status men. A woman who earns $50,000 only wants to date men who earn $100,000. Rich and successful women feel superior like no man is good enough for her, so she refuses to settle, she turns into a spinster, and now the whole world is sexually frustrated, which creates violence. The solution to violence is we need to ban women from the workplace, and ban women from colleges. Women should not work nor be educated. Women are happiest when they are at home raising children." Believe it or not, but many women agree with this philosophy.</p>

<p>Many TERFS claim to support LGBT, but yet they think of gays in terms of tops vs bottoms. They are using binary terms to describe non-binary people. Like they think in every gay relationship one person must role play as a man, and the other must role play as a woman. This is homophobic because it excludes non binaries like me who identify as neither male nor female.</p>

<h1>Critical Virginity Theory</h1>
<p>If you want to troll alpha women, tell them about Telegony. Charles Darwin was obsessed about Telegony, the theory that a woman's previous sex partners corrupts the epigenetics of her offsprings. Wikipedia says "Telegony is disproven and pseudoscientific." I believe our public schools should teach our children that having sex before marriage is an abomination. We need Critical Virginity Theory in our public schools.</p>

<p>You think men are fragile? Women are so fragile they banned the word "Thigh Gap" from Tik-Tok.</p>
