<h1>Banned For Misogyny</h1>
<p><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7086113528842784046">https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7086113528842784046</a></span><br>I was watching @kateao4's Tik-Tok video titled "How to test a man's protection abilities" and in that video she said "If you want to know if a man is husband material, throw an object at him, if he catches it, that means he has good reflexes, and good genes." And then I thought to myself "Wow she is a really good internet troll. I'm going to troll her back." So I left this comment on her video "Throwing objects at men is domestic violence. Tik-Tok moderators, do your thing." And she immediately blocked me! So I created a new Tik-Tok profile, so I could watch her old videos, and I was looking for clues on why she blocked me. I found her videos titled "I can pepper spray him <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7083575189719616814">1</a></span>" and "I feel like punching men <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7081310606191611178">2</a></span>" and "How to psychologically destroy a man's self esteem <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7086109036017487147">3</a></span>." Suddenly I realized, she's not an internet troll, she's just a crazy ass karen, and those are her genuine beliefs.</p>

<h1>Cinderella Complex</h1>
<p>She said "It's scientifically proven, men are happiest when they are protecting women. If you want to make a man fall in love, act afraid during a scary movie, and when he hugs you, he will feel like he is protecting you <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7067616961349373230">1</a></span>." That's literally what the slaves were taught "Blacks are happiest when they are serving the white race, by serving us, they are serving God." I'm supposed to bow down and worship women, that's why she blocked me, because I failed to obey God's law. You can watch her other Tik-Tok where she said "God says you must obey women, or else you will burn in hell. God says I am allowed to dress like a hoe. Thank you for listening to my sermon <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7086872634763349290">1</a>." You can watch her homophobic Tik-tok "Throughout history there was always an equal amount of men and women, even through two world wars, why is that? The answer is God created gays to help straight people mantain an operational sex ratio. Heterosexuals are the default. Gays are simply God's after thought, a necessary but evil bi-product of evolution <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/6946713318405065990">1</a></span>.</p>

<h1>Alpha Women - Toxic Femininity</h1>
<p>In one video, she said "It's impossible to be sexist against men <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7075419240802569518">1</a>. Misandry does not exist. All men have male privilege." In the next video, she said "If a woman hits her boyfriend, most likely she was a victim of emotional abuse, and therefore I support women's rights to hit their boyfriends. In fact, I like to hit my own boyfriend just for fun, because male and female bodies are built differently, so I'm allowed to hit my boyfriend, but he's not allowed to hit me back <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7081310606191611178">1</a>." In the next video, she said "There is never an excuse for a man to hit a woman. Nothing justifies it. Nothing." In the next video, she said "If a man cheats on you, I'll pin him down for you, while you chop off his d*ck."</p>

<p>In the next video, she said "When a man truly loves you, he will move mountains to be with you. Women should not chase men. Men must do the chasing <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7081756221035973934">1</a>." In the next video, she said "If a woman rejects you, get the f*ck over it. Women don't owe you sh*t." In one video, she said "If you are mentally unstable, your boyfriend should accept you for who you are, and be your emotional support <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7075776157827730730">1</a>." In the next video, she said "If your boyfriend is acting mentally unstable, dump him, you're not his therapist, charge him for your service <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7083185602589478190">1</a>." And then she said "Your boyfriend should be at the gym sculpting his mind and body so he can fight off a bear for you. If you dump him, and he commits suicide because of you, that's true love right there." She said "Only women are allowed to approach me in public. Men are not allowed, or else I will report you for sexual assault <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7085487951546731818">1</a>." So I'm supposed to move mountains, kill myself, and be an emotional support for women, and all I get in return is a used p*ssy.</p>

<p>Finally, she said "Men must follow the sidewalk rule. If he doesn't know about the sidewalk rule, dump him, he's toxic, uneducated, and immature." One user replied "Fun Fact: The sidewalk rule began in victorian england, so that carriages wouldn't splash mud on the lady! üòç"<br><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/3ziikUYi03I">https://youtu.be/3ziikUYi03I</a></span><br>I'm being holocausted because of my gender...</p>

<h1>My Coming Out Story</h1>
<p>So that's why now I identify as a non-binary gender fluid person. I'm tired of society telling me I'm a f*ggot because I'm not a tall muscular lumberjack. Everyday women are telling me "Can you hang a picture frame for me? Can you change the oil of my car? Can you install tiles?" I don't know how to do any of those things. Just cause I'm a man, don't make me a construction worker! I wouldn't hold the door for a man or a woman. If a bear was chasing us, survival of the fittest, bitch! I ain't gonna die for you. I ain't gonna live for you. I ain't gonna put you all on a pedestal. When Titanic sinks, I'm going to be the first person on the life-boat, first come first serve, bitch!</p>

<h1>TERF</h1>
<p class="four">@kateao4 is not a real feminist. She is a Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist (TERF). A normal feminist preaches "We must abolish the concept of masculinity and femininity. Gender is a social contruct. There is only one gender, the human gender. We must normalize teaching boys to play with dolls, wear skirts, and express emotions. It's okay for boys to cry. It's okay for girls to ride skateboards." A TERF preaches "Men and women should not switch gender roles, or else bad things will happen." For example, @kateao4 said "Crime is caused when men are too emotional. Real masculinity is when a man has mastered the art of controlling his emotions. <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7087273679171669294">1</a></span>" In other words, real men should not cry. That's why @kateao4 has so many double standards, because she wants to stop men from acting like women. She wants all men to act like Edward Cullen, her ideal version of masculinity.</p>

<p><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ninja.mommy/video/6938473679030324486">https://www.tiktok.com/@ninja.mommy/video/6938473679030324486</a></span><br>Another TERF is @ninja.mommy who said "Men and women do not have equal abilities. Each gender has their strength and weaknesses. We are polar opposites, ying & yang, designed to compliment each other. Think equity, not equality." In other words, never send a woman to do a man's job; vice versa. Men and women are a different sub-species.</p> 

<p class="three">"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." Quote by Karl Marx</p>

<p>Another TERF is Candace Owens who said <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/yxNTcMsULuY?t=300">1</a> "Will Smith is acting like a woman, that's why he can't satisfy Jada Pinkett's primal urge to be dominated. So that's why Jada Pinkett cheated on Will Smith. Hollywood has a transgender agenda. In fact, GI Jane is a movie about a woman who behaves like a man. Will Smith's son Jaden Smith is a cross dresser. We must fight the gay-pedophile-satanic elites who are trying to destroy objective masculinity & femininity. The nuclear family unit is the basis of civilization, if you destroy the nuclear family, you destroy civilization."</p>

<p>The nuclear family unit basically means you have to move out of your parent's house, get married, purchase a home in suburbia, and raise a family by age 25, or else you are a failure, and if you get divorced you are also a failure. The scientist Jordan Peterson is a TERF who wants to make sex-before-marriage illegal, and divorcing illegal, with his theory called "Enforced Monogamy." His theories are backed by science and God.</p>

<p>The most extreme form of TERF idealogy comes the author of "Hard Times Create Strong Men" Stefan Aarnio who said <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/mt7XVqkrFKg">1</a> "Women are hardwired for hypergamy. Biologically, women have high standards, they only wants to date high status men. A woman who earns $50,000 only wants to date men who earn $100,000. Rich and successful women feel superior like no man is good enough for her, so she refuses to settle, she turns into a spinster, and now the whole world is sexually frustrated, which creates violence. The solution to violence is we need to ban women from the workplace, and ban women from colleges. Women should not work nor be educated. Women are happiest when they are at home raising children." Believe it or not, but many women agree with this philosophy.</p>

<p>Many TERFS claim to support LGBT, but yet they think of gays in terms of tops vs bottoms, binary terms to describe non-binary people. Like they think in every gay relationship one person must role play as a man, and the other must role play as a woman. This is transphobic because it excludes non binaries like me who identify as neither male nor female.</p>

<p>If I say one bad thing about women, women will tell me "You're just a little faggot who can't get laid." That's literally what @kateao4 told someone <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateao4/video/7080581573657070890">1</a>. I'm telling you, she is transphobic. She thinks just because I am a man, that I'm supposed to have sex. Truly, my only dream in life is I just want world peace. World peace is more important than sex. I would stay a virgin forever in exchange for world peace. STFU you stupid ass racist TERF, all you want is a big fat diamond ring, all I want is world peace, you're not on the same level as me.</p>

<p>You think men are fragile? Women are so fragile they banned the phrase "Thigh Gap" from Tik-Tok.</p>
