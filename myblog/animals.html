<p>Please have a look at my sister's instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/frenchfriesfrenchdogs/">@FrenchFriesFrenchDogs</a>. I am going to describe how my sister, and my sister's boyfriend abuse animals. Then, I will describe how latinos in my neighborhood abuse animals.</p>

<h1>Death of a Dog</h1>
<p>One day my sister's friend said "Does anyone want my dog? My dog's name is Rocky. If you don't take my dog, I am sending him to a dog pound." My sister replied "Oh, I accept your offer. This dog is cute. My sons will clean the poop. My sons will learn many valuable life lessons because of this dog." My sister adopted Rocky. Several weeks later, Rocky ran away, he was hit by a car and he died. This was no accident at all, you will soon learn. Through the story of Ada, you will soon learn Rocky's death was completely preventable.</p>

<h1>Ada the Dog</h1>
<p>My sister uses instagram to advertise the dogs she is selling. The dog breeding started with Ada. Look at Ada's photo here <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BxdPOkRlbgO/">[1]</a>. Every few months, my sister forced Ada to give birth. My sister was without a license to breed animals. My sister's neighbor complained to the animal control about the stink of dog poop eminating from my sister's home. The animal control gave my sister a legal warning. My sister was forced to stop breeding dogs. My sister's son told me "My mother and step-father are planning on moving to another jurisdiction where the dog breeding laws are lenient. They are planning to breed dogs again."</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>
<p>My sister loves purebreed animals, but she hates racist people. This irony I don't understand it. My relative asked my sister "How could you sell dogs to strangers on the internet? That's inhumane. You don't know if those dogs will live in good or bad homes." My sister's boyfriend replied "French bulldogs are worth thousands of dollars. Anyone who is willing to pay thousands of dollars for a dog obviously will take excellent care of it. We are not selling these dogs to impoverished ghetto people. Only rich people can afford our dogs. Rich people are less likely to be criminals, because rich people can afford a higher education. Every problem in this world is caused by income inequality."</p>

<h1>Bullies People</h1>
<p>My sister welcomed me by saying "Thank you so much, this is the laptop I need you to install Microsoft Office on. I am almost done with it. Hold on, very quickly, I just need to order dog food online for my dog Ada." My sister shouted at her boyfriend "Boyfriend, what dog food should I order, lamb or rabbit?" My sister's boyfriend replied "Either will suffice." My sister replied "I am going to order the rabbit food, Ada really loves rabbit meat, she finished our last batch nearly twice as fast." At this point my sister was staring at her boyfriend with a demonic smile on her face, and then my sister said to me "Wait a minute Jovanny, don't you own a bunch of rabbits and stuff? You love them, you take care of them." The room was silent. I replied "Yes, I own 5 rabbits." My sister bursted into a demonic laughter "Hahaha that is hilarious! My dog's favorite food is rabbit, and you own 5 rabbits! Hahaha you should see my dog, she loves eating rabbits. She jumps all over for rabbit meat. I bet if my dog saw your rabbits, my dog would instantly devour your rabbits." I never told anyone about this. Then, months later my relative said to me "I was at your sister's house today, your sister was sitting around a table with her group of BLM friends. Your sister told everyone "Did you know my brother owns 5 rabbits, but my dog's favorite thing to eat is rabbit meat! Hahaha!" They all laughed at you." I am having a flashback about when my sister first saw my rabbits, she said to me "What is the point of this? Rabbits are stupid, they don't even do any tricks."</p>

<h1>Broken Fence</h1>
<p>Powerful winds broke my sister's fence at the hinges. My sister's boyfriend purchases the latest Nike Air Jordan shoes and Adidas Yeezy shoes, but refused to pay the cost to repair his own fence. My sister's boyfriend was standing next to that broken fence, he was sipping an alcoholic beverage, and he told me "I am going to repair this fence tomorrow. I just need to purchase a special screw from Home Depot. It's an easy repair." My sister's boyfriend went into great detail describing how this repair would be accomplished. I felt confident that he would repair this fence. Several weeks later, I returned to my sister's home, and that fence was still broken. I didn't mention anything about the fence, but I said to my sister's boyfriend "Ada is outside shivering in these strong Autumn winds." My sister's boyfriend replied "Ada sleeps indoors with me during the night, when the winds are the srongest. Anyways, I'm going to purchase a carboard box from Home Depot to protect Ada from the wind." My sister's boyfriend grabbed his car keys and immediately drove away. That same night, I returned to my sister's home because I had forgotten my cell phone there. That same night, I saw Ada was outside shivering without a cardboard box. In other words, my sister's boyfriend constantly lies and makes false promises. And that was how Ada ran away, because their fence remained broken for many months. My sister posted "Dog Missing" signs all around her neighborhood. Several weeks later, they found Ada.</p>

<h1>Repaired Fence</h1>
<p>My sister finally repaired her fence, but Ada continued to run away. Because my sister invites strangers into her home who are unaware that my sister owns a dog, some of those strangers left the fence wide open. One time I visited my sister's home, I opened the fence door, and Ada bolted away between my legs. Ada ran away so incredibly fast. My sister said "Did you close the front gate?" Luckily, I closed the front gate, but not everyone closes the front gate, and that's why Ada often went missing. Ada usually returned in a few hours, but sometimes Ada went missing for several days or weeks. My sister posted even more "Dog Missing" signs in our neighborhood. Then, my sister owned a dog named Bruce. Bruce ran away from my sister's house. They found Bruce on a sidewalk next to speeding cars, motels, and prostitutes. Now you have seen, my sister's extensive history of her pets running away due to negligence. That is how Rocky's death was preventable. And guess what? My sister's first son runs away too. Also, I run away from my own sister everytime I see her, because I am disgusted by her presence.</p>

<h1>Instagram Lies</h1>
<p>My sister's life seems perfect on instagram. Behind the perfect photos, there are mountains of empty beer cans in her home. There are random holes on her door and walls because her boyfriend randomly gets angry and punches a wall or door. Then, my sister said "We sold a dog to a very wealthy European person. Now the dog we sold is famous on instagram. There's a video of the dog we sold running around on a beautiful green lawn on a beautiful mansion estate. You see, I am a good person. Dog breeding is a legitimate way to earn money." Here is the video of it <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKtD2RJhuL7/">@GucciDaFrenchiee</a>. I was almost convinced. But then something very sad was realized at a Violent Party.</p>

<h1>Violent Party</h1>
<p>My sister went to a Violent Party which you can read about here. My sister sold a dog to a latina woman. At this violent party, the latina woman's boyfriend pointed a gun at his girlfriend. As my sister was running away from the scary man with a gun, my sister saw that the poor little puppy she sold to them was cowering in a corner so very terrified by the loud music, the shouting, and the commotion. My sister picked the puppy up and kidnapped it to save it from that unstable household. My sister said "We sold a dog to some very bad people. The dog was living in an abusive home. It was so sad." A few days later, the latina woman told my sister "My boyfriend and I, we are seeing a relationship therapist now. Can we please have our dog back?" And my sister gave them back their puppy.</p>

<h1>End of Ada</h1>
<p>I mentioned the animal control forced my sister to stop breeding dogs. Now that Ada the dog was unable to generate money for my sister, Ada's body became useless trash. My sister and her boyfriend simply forgot about Ada. My sister's home is disgusting, her home had infestations of cockroaches and mice. My sister purchased poison pellets to exterminate. Ada ate the poison pellets and had a seizure from it. Ada began vomitting, her body trembling, her body collapsed on the floor, foam around her mouth. We believed Ada died. But Ada did survive. A few weeks later, at this point, throughout all of this Ada always had fleas, she was constantly scratching herself, but now Ada was also covered with Mange Mites. Ada had bald patches all around her body. My sister asked different people "Does anyone want my dog? My dog's name is Ada. If you don't take my dog, I am sending her to a dog pound." My sister's step-sister replied "Oh, I accept your offer. This dog is cute. My sons will clean the poop. My sons will learn many valuable life lessons because of this dog." That woman adopted Ada. A veterinarian bathed Ada in sulfur to cleanse her mites. And that was the last I heard about Ada. And just so you know, that woman who adopted Ada. Yeah, that woman's boyfriend is named Henry. Henry is a known child abuser, you can read about it here.</p>

<h1>Neighbors</h1>
<p>I live in a ghetto neighborhood of mostly latinos. I hate these people. They don't care about animals here. I see homeless rabbits, chickens, hamsters, dogs, and cats, all of them walking around on public sidewalks and roads. Those are not wild animals. Latinos here own pets, and they don't care about their pets, so their pets escape. My BLM uncle said "I saw a man carrying a small rabbit. The man put his rabbit on the ground, and then he walked away without his rabbit. He abandoned his rabbit in our neighborhood." And then my BLM uncle's friend replied "I've seen that before. That's what people do here. They abandon their pets next to the freeway where there are plants and trees." My BLM uncle replied "Yeah, that is where he abandoned his rabbit."</p>

<p>I saw a chicken walking on the sidewalk, the chicken did not cross the road at all. That chicken was a genius, he knew not to cross the road because of the speeding cars. I think the chicken had a home, it just got lost. I saw a homeless hamster running around at night. There's homeless cats all over. My relative said "If you think our town is bad, you should see Compton, CA." Apparently, there are farms at Compton, CA. When I was a kid, my step-father took me to a farm at Compton, CA. It was a latino man's house. It looked nothing like a farm, it was just a normal house. The latino man walked us to his garage, and there were the goats or cows. The latino man gave me a styrofoam cup of frothy warm milk. As a kid, I didn't realize the animals I was staring at was the source for the milk I was drinking. As a kid, I was thinking to myself "This disgusting warm and gray substance was not designed for human consumtion. This isn't milk. Milk is cold and white like from a refrigerator."</p>

<p>Dogs are unrestrained in my neighborhood. Latinos don't walk their dogs here. They simply leave their gates wide open, the dogs walk themselves. My relatives tell me "That's how everyone does it in Mexico." My BLM uncle leaves the gate open for his dog named Fluffy. My sister said "OMG you will never believe who I saw at the donut shop. It was Fluffy. Fluffy had a gang of dogs, and all the dogs were interacting like they were best friends." My BLM cousin replied "Yeah, Fluffy does that. Our neighbors leave their gates open for their dogs. Some dogs are friends, some are enemies. Fluffy has been in fights with some dogs. Fluffy has come home with blood from his fights."</p>

<h1>White House</h1>
<p>I've seen homeless rabbits in my neighborhood. I was just walking to the store, when I saw this rabbit. I stopped to stare at it, I even took a picture of it. When I retured from the store, the rabbit was still there. Suddenly, two people, a man, and a man, approached me and the man said "Hello, this is our rabbit. It lives on our front yard, and back yard. It loves to eat grass. We found this rabbit, it was hopping around. Someone probably abandoned it. We leave a bowl of water, and so it lives with us. Sometimes it walks to our neighbor's house. This rabbit has a life of it's own. Isn't it beautiful?" The woman said "We had another rabbit but we haven't seen it for several days. Oh look, there it is. Nature is so beautiful." The man said "We are just a little drunk." The two had very large eyes, I am fairly certain they both were high on methamphetamine. Anyways, the two really sold me on their vision of a free world for animals. Many months later, the animal control visited my house, they asked me about some rabbits. I showed them my rabbits. The animal control said "No, these are not the rabbits I am searching for. I am searching for a white house, here is a photo of the house I am searching for. I believe, the suspects are your neigbors. With your permission, may I enter your backyard to look over your fence?" Everything seemed rather suspicious to me. The animal control said "I couldn't get a good view of it. I was told this white house has rabbits running around unrestrained and reproducing uncontrollably. Do know anything about that?" I kept thinking it was about my rabbits, that somehow this white house story was a lie. The animal control left. My relatives asked me "Why was the animal control here?" As I began explaining what the animal control had asked me, I was struck with a sudden realization. Suddenly, I remembered the house where I saw the homeless rabbits from a long time ago, it was a white house, the same house the animal control showed me in those photos. The animal control was staring at the incorrect white house, but both white houses look very similar on the exterior. Then, I started to feel very sorry because I didn't realize it was animal abuse to have rabbits roaming around freely like that. I didn't want to judge people for how they raise their pets. In some ways, I felt like their rabbits were happier than mine, because theirs were free, but mine lived in cages. And that is the lesson I learned, I always thought animal abusers looked like big scary heartless people, but that is not true. The ones I met seemed very happy to be alive, they were very cheery and happy, like cracked out methamphetamine happy, they loved nature, people, and animals. I don't know how may months it has been. Today, I walked past that house again. I saw a piece of flattened fur on the asphalt where cars are parked, a rabbit carcass. That's why I don't trust hippies. Hippies are like this guy from the Forrest Gump film. Hippies want peace, love, and anti-war, and then behind closed doors they punch women.</p> 

<h1>Blue House</h1>
<p>One summer I heard an argument from my blue house neighbors. I didn't think much about it, it's sort of normal here. It sounded like a drunk father was yelling at his family. My relative said "I hear them arguing all the time." As for me, I rarely heard arguments there. During the next summer, my blue house neighbors had a group of their male friend there, smoking marijuana, laughing, listening to music. One scorching hot day, my blue house neighbors had a very small inflatable swimmimg pool, there were no children there, it was just one latina woman wearing a bikini in the pool, she was surrounded by fully clothed latino men sipping beers, listening to hip hop music, smoking marijuana. Their voices were very confident and loud. When the latina woman, left they turned off the music. One latino man said "Ayee, you know that homegirl in the swimming pool went to the party last week. She was so drunk that she passed out in front of everybody, and the homie..." Suddenly, his voice changed, everyone was very quit. He continued "The homie raped her while she was passed out." It was dead silent. One latino man laughed "Hahaha!" The other latino man said "Why you laugh holmes? That ain't cool." He replied "It got awkward all of a sudden. Pass the blunt." He replied "And the craziest part, she still has no idea, she doesn't know she was raped." The other replied "That's crazy..." Something tells me they don't care, and they never told her that she was raped.</p>

<p>That same summer, I noticed my blue house neighbors had a dog. There was a strong odor of dog feces. Each week, my blue house nieghbors, there was a butch latina woman with tattoos, she had earbuds on, she swept the dog feces, she poured a bucket of water and scrubbed the concrete with a wet broom. I heard her shout to someone "You never do s**t. I always do everything. You're lazy." I don't know how many weeks or months later it was. One night my entire family heard barking, growling, and moaning noises. We all huddled over and looked over our blue house neighbor's fence, and we saw two dogs, one pitbull was chewing the leg of another dog. There was nothing we could do. Every night for about 2 weeks straight, we heard barking, growling, and moaning for about one hour per day. Everytime we looked over, we saw the two dogs fighting. And here is the worst of this story. One night we looked over the fence, we saw blood on the dog's legs. I saw an illuminated white rectangle through their window, it was a man laying down staring at his smartphone. The man was scrolling through some random app, and he yelled "Shut the fuck up b***h, I'm trying to sleep." My mother said "Oh no we should leave, he is talking to us." I replied "He was talking to his dog." Literally, this latino man was inches away from his dog that was all crying and covered in blood, but he didn't care. Obviously we called the animal control. Finally the animal control arrived. Then out of nowhere we heard someone in our blue house neighbor's scream as loud as possible, it was a female voice "ARE YOU HAPPY NOW YOU F***ING B***H, I KNOW IT WAS YOU!" Suddenly her voice turned to sadness, "They took my dogs away..."</p>
