<p>Please have a look at my sister's instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/frenchfriesfrenchdogs/">@FrenchFriesFrenchDogs</a>. I am going to describe how my sister, and my sister's boyfriend abuse animals. Then, I will describe how latinos in my neighborhood abuse animals.</p>

<h1>Death of a Dog</h1>
<p>One day my sister's friend said "Does anyone want my dog? My dog's name is Rocky. If you don't take my dog, I am sending him to a dog pound." My sister replied "Oh, I accept your offer. This dog is cute. My sons will clean the poop. My sons will learn many valuable life lessons because of this dog." My sister adopted Rocky. Several weeks later, Rocky ran away, he was hit by a car and he died. This was no accident at all, you will soon learn. Through the story of Ada, you will soon learn Rocky's death was completely preventable.</p>

<h1>Ada the Dog</h1>
<p>My sister uses instagram to advertise the dogs she is selling. The dog breeding started with Ada. Look at Ada's photo here <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BxdPOkRlbgO/">[1]</a>. Every few months, my sister forced Ada to give birth. My sister was without a license to breed animals. My sister's neighbor complained to the animal control about the stink of dog poop eminating from my sister's home. The animal control gave my sister a legal warning. My sister was forced to stop breeding dogs. My sister's son told me "My mother and step-father are planning on moving to another jurisdiction where the dog breeding laws are lenient. They are planning to breed dogs again."</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>
<p>My sister loves purebreed animals, but she hates racist people. This irony I don't understand it. My relative asked my sister "How could you sell dogs to strangers on the internet? That's inhumane. You don't know if those dogs will live in good or bad homes." My sister's boyfriend replied "We are not selling these dogs to impoverished ghetto people. French bulldogs are worth thousands of dollars. Anyone who is willing to pay thousands of dollars for a dog obviously will take excellent care of it. Every problem in this world is caused by income inequality. Rich people are less likely to be criminals, because they have access to a higher education."</p>

<h1>The Broken Fence</h1>
<p>One very windy Autumn season, powerful winds broke my sister's fence at the hinges. My sister's boyfriend purchases the latest Nike Air Jordan shoes and Adidas Yeezy shoes, but he refused to pay the cost to repair his own fence. My sister's boyfriend was standing next to that broken fence, he was sipping an alcoholic beverage, and he told me "I am going to repair this fence tomorrow. I just need to purchase a special screw from Home Depot. It's an easy repair." My sister's boyfriend perfectly described how the repair would be done. I was confident that he would repair this fence. Several weeks later, I returned to my sister's home, and that fence was still broken. I didn't mention anything about the fence, but I said to my sister's boyfriend "Ada is outside shivering in these strong Autumn winds." My sister's boyfriend replied "Ada sleeps indoors with me during the night. Anyways, I'm going to purchase a carboard box from Home Depot to protect Ada from the wind." My sister's boyfriend grabbed his car keys and immediately drove away. That same night, I returned to my sister's home because I had forgotten my cell phone there. That same night, I saw Ada was outside shivering without a cardboard box. In other words, my sister's boyfriend constantly lies and makes false promises. And that was how Ada ran away, because their fence remained broken for many months. My sister posted "Dog Missing" signs all around her neighborhood. Several weeks later, a neighbor returned Ada to my sister. They found Ada.</p>

<p>My sister finally repaired her fence, but Ada continued to run away. Because my sister invites strangers into her home who are unaware that my sister owns a dog, some of those strangers left the fence wide open. One time I visited my sister's home, I opened the fence door, and Ada bolted away between my legs. Ada ran away so incredibly fast. My sister said "Did you close the front gate?" Luckily, I closed the front gate, but not everyone closes the front gate, and that's why Ada often went missing. Ada usually returned in a few hours, but sometimes Ada went missing for several days or weeks. My sister posted even more "Dog Missing" signs in our neighborhood. Then, my sister owned a dog named Bruce. Bruce ran away from my sister's house. They found Bruce on a sidewalk next to speeding cars, motels, and prostitutes nearby a four way intersection.</p>

<p>Believe it or not. The story does not end here. I am still writing it.</p>
