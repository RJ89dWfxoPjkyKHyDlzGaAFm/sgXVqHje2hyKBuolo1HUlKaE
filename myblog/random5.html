<p class="two">In 2019, Robert Evans created a podcast called "Worst Year Ever" where he predicted 2020 was going to be the worst year ever. Also in 2019, Robert created a podcast called "It Could Happen Here" where he predicted a second American civil war will begin around 2020. Here is Robert Evans calling for the public execution of Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="random5\robert3.webm"></audio></span><br>Robert Evans wishes death to Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="random5\robert4.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="random5\robert2.webm"></audio></span><br>Robert Evans celebrates the death of Herman Cain.<span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="random5\robert5.webm"></audio></span><br>Robert Evans wants an armed militia to murder fossil fuel executives.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="random5\robert.webm"></audio></span><br>Robert wants a death squad to murder Mike Pence.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="random5\robert6.webm"></audio></span><br>Robert Evans wants Peter McCullough and Robert Malone sentenced to death by stoning.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="random5\robert7.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="random5\robert8.webm"></audio></span><br>On Twitter <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/IwriteOK/status/1478178319740723201">1</a>,</span><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/IwriteOK/status/1280358171333148673">2</a>,</span> Robert wishes death to Jair Bolsonaro.<img src="images\jair.avif">When Robert Evans was a young man, he used to fantasize about nuking the USA.

You can also listen to Robert Evan's podcast "The Assault on America" to learn why January 6 is equal to 9/11 and Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p class="two"><img src="savior.webp">The above movies are racist because of White Savior Narrative. For example, in the movie Freedom Writers. A white woman walked into a colored neighborhood, and she "rescued" brown people. In reality, she colonized that brown neighborhood, and she whitewashed/assimilated those brown students, exactly like an Indian Boarding school. She rescued brown people as if she were rescuing dogs from an animal shelter. If Freedom Writers wants to stop being racist, they should have a black teacher rescuing some rednecks.<br><br>For example, in the movie Green Book. A racist white man had a change of heart. And because he had a change of heart, he rescued a helpess black man. That is like saying black people are so stupid that they can't live without white people. If this movie wants to stop being racist, they should put a black man overcoming a struggle without a white person being there to rescue him. According to Wikipedia, there are 243 documentary films about the Holocaust <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Holocaust_films#Documentary_films">1</a>,</span> but only 15 documentary films about slavery <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Documentary_films_about_slavery_in_the_United_States">2</a>.</span></p>

<h1>Social Conditioning</h1>
<p class="two">According to liberals, biological sex is a social construct exactly like race is a social construct. There is no such thing as "man" or "woman." And there is no such thing as "European" or "African." Heterosexuality is another social construct. The only reason you are heterosexual is because all your life you were brainwashed into believing homosexuality was a bad thing. And deep down you repressed your innate homosexuality because of the lies systemic oppression created. Atleast that is what liberals believe. You can watch this Youtube documentary about how heterosexuality is created through "Social Conditioning."

<h1>Sambia Tribe</h1>
<p class="two">The Sambia tribe who live in Papua New Guinea practice a tradition of forcing 7 year old boys to perform oral sex, and drink the semen of older men. Semen drinking is a "right of passage" into adulthood. According to liberals, forcing boys to drink semen is a peaceful tradition which white people should learn to love, appreciate, and preserve. According to liberals, drinking semen is not sexual at all to those Sambia boys. It only appears sexual to white people because white people are judgmental. In nature there is no such thing as a right or a wrong way to have sex. 90% of giraffes practice homosexuality. If you put any two animals in a cage, those animals will have sex regardless of sex and age. Animals will have sex even with their own family members. Humans are the only species on Earth who arbitrarily decided certain types of sex is wrong. According to liberals, semen drinking is the Sambia version of a sweet sixteen, or a quinceanera. White people have no right to stop the Sambia semen tradition. Just let them be. If you try to stop the Sambia semen tradition, you are a white supremacist and a nazi.<video controls preload="none">

<p class="two">This below chart says biological sex is a social construct <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/visualizing-sex-as-a-spectrum/">1</a>.</span> According to liberals, the theory of sex being determined by chromosomes was invented by white supremacists who believed sex is binary because the Bible said God created only two sexes called Adam and Eve. Obviously, the Bible is wrong. In 2017, modern science proved there is an unlimited number of genders and sexes. In 2019, science proved there is no sexual orientation gene <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/there-is-no-gay-gene-there-is-no-straight-gene-sexuality-is-just-complex-study-confirms">1</a>,</span><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aat7693">2</a>.</span> There is no straight gene, and there is no gay gene.<img src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/File/051_sad0917MontA3p-01.png"></p>

<p class="two">According to liberals, this chart below justifies abortion. The chart says babies can't feel pain even after exiting the womb. They say babies start feeling pain only around 8 months after birth.<img src="images\nociception.avif">Source:<span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1136/bmj.332.7546.909">1</a>.</span></p>
