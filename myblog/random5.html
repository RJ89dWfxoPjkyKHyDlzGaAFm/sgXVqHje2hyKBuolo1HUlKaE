<p class="two">In 2019, Robert Evans created a podcast called "Worst Year Ever" where he predicted 2020 was going to be the worst year ever. Also in 2019, Robert created a podcast called "It Could Happen Here" where he predicted a second American civil war will begin around 2020. Here is Robert Evans calling for the public execution of Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="random5\robert3.webm"></audio></span><br>Robert Evans wishes death to Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="random5\robert4.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="random5\robert2.webm"></audio></span><br>Robert Evans celebrates the death of Herman Cain.<span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="random5\robert5.webm"></audio></span><br>Robert Evans says in order to be a good person you should have a strong desire in your heart to murder fossil fuel executives.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="random5\robert.webm"></audio></span><br>Robert wants a death squad to murder Mike Pence.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="random5\robert6.webm"></audio></span></p>
<p class="two"><img src="savior.webp">The above movies are racist because of White Savior Narrative. For example, in the movie Freedom Writers. A white woman walked into a colored neighborhood, and she "rescued" brown people. In reality, she colonized that brown neighborhood, and she whitewashed/assimilated those brown students, exactly like an Indian Boarding school. She rescued brown people as if she were rescuing dogs from an animal shelter. If Freedom Writers wants to stop being racist, they should have a black teacher rescuing some rednecks.<br><br>For example, in the movie Green Book. A racist white man had a change of heart. And because he had a change of heart, he rescued a helpess black man. That is like saying black people are so stupid that they can't live without white people. If this movie wants to stop being racist, they should put a black man overcoming a struggle without a white person being there to rescue him. According to Wikipedia, there are 243 documentary films about the Holocaust <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Holocaust_films#Documentary_films">1</a>,</span> but only 15 documentary films about slavery <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Documentary_films_about_slavery_in_the_United_States">2</a>.</span></p>
