<p>These are the stories that influenced my political opinions.</p>
<p>I have some stories but there's so much details. It's complicated to explain. I will try.</p>

<p>My name is Jovanny Rodriguez. My mother was born in Yucatan, Mexico. My father was born in Jalisco, Mexico. I was born and raised in California, USA.<p>

<p>My parents divorced when I was an infant. When I was a kid, I visited my father fortnightly on Sundays only. On fortnights my father drove me and my sister to his friend's house. I don't know why my dad just left us there. I was supposed to experience quality time with my father, but my father ignored us. My father talked for hours with his friend. When my sister wasn't there, I heard my father telling his friend "I purchased a high defintion television. Pornography is amazing on it. The details are perspiration of the naked woman's body. I enjoy watching women spreading their legs." My father thought I couldn't understand spanish, that's why he said those things in front of me. I hate my father so much because of what happened.</p>

<p>One fortnight my father drove away and left me and my sister there at his friend's house where I met Salatiel. Salatiel was an old school salvadorian gangster with tattoos and shaved head. Salatiel owned a chrome lowrider bicycle with long handle bars. One day, Salatiel was in an attic and returned with a blue pencil box which carried gameboy cartridges. Salatiel then gave me a rubiks cube, and explained that I should make each side one color. I sat there on a sofa, waiting for my father to return, and Salatiel dissapeared into his bedroom. More than a decade later around 2019, I found out the entire time that I had been at Salatiel's house on the sofa playing rubiks cube and gameboy cartridges, Salatiel was in another room sexually abusing my sister. And the only reason Salatiel gave me those games was to get rid of me.</p>

<p>I remember being a kid, and my mother was yelling at me to go in the car. My mother drove me to a skyscraper. A woman called my name. I was alone in a room with a pale white woman. The woman asked me "Do you ever feel hungry?" I replied "Yeah, I like to eat potato chips." The woman laughed and replied "Do you have a refrigerator in your home? If I went to your home and opened the refrigerator, would there be food in there?" I replied "Yeah. That is how refrigerators are designed." Eventually, the woman asked "Do you know who is Salatiel? Does that sound familiar?" I answered all her questions. I didn't know why she asked those questions until 2019 that I found out what Salatiel did. The woman was trying to ask me if Salatiel sexually abused me.</p>

<p>Salatiel was never arrested for what he did to my sister. Salatiel was arrested for drugs. When Salaitel was released from prison, he ran away to Mexico. During 2019, I asked my father questions about my childhood, and my father said "I don't blame myself for what happened to your sister and Salatiel. I was young and foolish. I learned from my mistakes." My mother said "Your sister was dating a thug named Marvin who was in a rival gang against Salatiel. I thought your sister was lying. I thought it was gang related. That is why I commanded the police to not file a police report against Salatiel."</p>

<p>So my sister was addicted to methamphetamine ever since elementary school, middle school, and high school. It's possible that Salatiel was the one who introduced methamphetamine to my sister, but we don't know. My sister invited these grownups into our home, and my mother never knew about it. It was these men with tattoos. As a kid, I observed their mannerism, and they seemed very relaxed. I wanted to be like them. I wanted to join a gang like them. My life was going for me to become a gangmember, except one year I got a handheld playstation portable device. It arrived with some promotional music videos. I discovered this specific song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFObU6-qN_k">[1]</a>. I kept listening to the song on repeat. It was how I stopped being a gangster and started being a rockstar.</p>

<p>Through my elementary school years, about once a month there was a big argument in my home. My mom was arguing with my sister. And sometimes the police was there. For example, one time my step-father blocked my bedroom door. I heard them yelling. What happened is the police wanted to interrogate my sister, because my sister witnessed a murder or something like that. But my sister took off all her clothes and ran around the streets screaming "F**k the police! Haha, somebody help! The police is trying to rape me!" What murder did my sister witness? Well one time my sister was crying and saying she saw her friend got killed in a driveby. One time my sister was crying because she was high and drinking beer with a bunch of thugs. My sister vomit in their white van. So the thugs opened the van door and threw my sister out in the street of Watts, California. And they drove away. Then one time my sister was crying because her back was bleeding, and there was broken beer bottle glass shards all over her back. Noone knows what happened, except her. </p>
