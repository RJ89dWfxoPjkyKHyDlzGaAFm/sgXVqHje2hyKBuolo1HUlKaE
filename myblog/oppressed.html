<h1>Taco Bell</h1>
<p>I was ordering food at Taco Bell. The Taco Bell employees were african-american. My food took a long time because the employees were distracted by the loud conversation they were having. One black man said to another black man "Haha and who was the longest relationship you've been in?" He replied "That's actually a funny story." He replied "What's her instagram?" He replied "I dated this woman for one entire year. There was just one problem, she didn't want sex, she wanted marriage." He replied "Haha I've been there before. And what did you do next? Did you lie to her?" He replied "She was the finest woman I ever laid eyes on. The instant I saw her, I knew I wanted to f**k her p***y. I sent her good morning and goodnight texts every day. I told her I wanted to marry her, and have kids with her. I brought her flowers and chocolates. I did all that cute s**t women love." He replied "You gotta do what you gotta do. That's cool. You had a classy woman and then you was f**king h**s on the side." He replied "I am telling you this woman was gorgeous. I didn't want to ruin my chances with her." He replied "Haha are you telling me you went one entire year without sex?!" He replied "Haha yes, and finally after one year together she finally let me f**k her. And that was it for me. The very next day, I messaged some h*es, and started cheating. I went one entire year without sex, it was worth it, I have her naked pictures and a sex tape if you wanna see." About 18 months later, that Taco Bell had shut down, and they built a Starbucks on top of it. I don't know if the employees had anything to do with it, but I rarely saw customers in that Taco Bell. On this particular day, there was only one other customer that I saw, it was a tall white man who seemed like he was on methamphetamine.</p> 


<h1>Stealing Amazon Packages</h1>
<p>My uncle and his friends claim to be oppressed. My uncle's latino friend said "I've been racially profiled before. I was just walking at night to my grandmother's house and the cops frisked me." I replied "But look at how you're dressed. You look like a thug. You have tattoos." He replied "It shouldn't matter what I look like. I wasn't doing a crime. Why don't cops stop white people for driving in nice cars and wearing tuxedos if they might be doing white collar crimes?" One time my uncle said "They sent this amazon package to the wrong address. What should I do with it?" My uncle's same latino friend replied "F**k it, it was on your property, that means it's yours." My uncle replied "F**k it, Jeff Bezos is rich. Amazon should pay their employees better wages to stop incorrect deliveries. It's amazon's fault. Our neighbor can get a refund." They opened the box and it was an Amazon Fire Tablet. My uncle said "I wish they sent an iPad. This piece of s**t is only worth $50." And they kept it.</p>

<h1>Consumerism</h1>
<p>You will never see my oppressed relatives shopping at Walmart. They only shop at Target. They don't go to just any Target either, they only go to the ones in white neighborhoods. My oppressed uncle said "Do you want to know why I hate Walmart? Just go on google images and type 'People of Walmart memes.'" My uncle's latino oppressed friend said "The Target in white neighborhoods sell better clothing styles." My obese oppressed cousin loves Starbucks, Krispy Kreme, and Cinnabon, yet she only goes to the Starbucks in white neighborhoods because the ones in ghetto neighborhoods have slow service and give the incorrect order. That's another thing. My oppressed family always complains about slow service and rude employees. They complain about everything. They hate capitalism and yet they are the ones buying everything.  

<h1>My Sister</h1>
<p>My sister is so oppressed, one month she says "I am on the Keto diet," the next month "I am on the raw food diet," the next month "I downloaded an app called HealthyWage that pays you money to lose weight." Finally, my sister got liposuction and breast augmentation. My sister and her boyfriend are so oppressed, they own a brand new car, three televisions, there are unopened amazon boxes all over their porch and living room, an entire 7'x7' shed of tools, Snap-On branded tools, the latest samsung galaxy phones, mountains of nike and adidas clothes and shoes. They have two children. The USDA says its costs $233,610 to raise one child.</p>

<h1>Dog Breeding</h1>
<p>My sister already has two children, and she says "I wish I could have more children. But I just can't anymore because giving birth is so stressful to my body. But I just love children. I feel like a home without children is depressing." The irony is, my sister was breeding French Bulldogs. Literally, every 6 months my sister forced this female dog to be pregnant. Then they would give this dog Ceasarean section.</p>


<h1>Ada</h1>
<p>The primary dog my sister owned is named Ada. In the beginning, Ada would run away very often, and be lost for a couple hours. Ada ran away very often because my sister's fence was broke for 2 months, and when they finally repaired it, people would forget to close it. One time Ada ran away for a whole week, until someone returned her. One time Ada ran away for an entire month, then she came back pregnant. The people who returned her said "We saw this beautiful dog. We got her pregnant. We were planning on selling the puppies until we saw the lost dog signs on the street. Then we felt sorry because this dog had a family." Ada got pregnant a bunch of times. My sister had an entire instagram for attracting customers. My sister's primary customers were wealthy hipster libtards who lived in San Francisco, where there are more dogs than children <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/san-francisco-may-have-more-dogs-than-children-heres-why">[2]</a>. My sister did everything illegally, she had no permit to breed dogs, and she sold dogs under 8 weeks old, she breeded the same dog twice in one year. I twice reported my sister to the animal control. 

<p>Demise of Ada</h1>
<p>So the reason my sister's fence broke was because of the strong Santa Ana winds in California. One day, it was windy and I saw Ada was shivering in my sister's backyard. I told my relatives that Ada was shivering and literally noone cared. My sister's boyfriend said "I will purchase a cardboard box from homedepot to protect her from the wind. Dogs are filthy animals, they belong outdoors." He never purchased any carboard box. The next week, I saw Ada shivering outside again. Finally, the animal control went to my sister's house, they got one legal warning. My sister temporarily stopped breeding dogs. She is planning to breed dogs again in a different state where the laws are different. In the end, Ada became useless to my sister, so they neglected her. In the end, Ada was severely infested and balding with mange mites. My sister's house is disgusting, so they buy chemicals from Mexico that is supposed to kill mice. Ada ate one of those </p>

<h1>Animal Abuse</h1>
<p>One time I saw my sister's 7 year old son punching one of their dogs, he was punching the dog really hard and yelling in the dog's ear "Go in the house! Go in the house!" Then I asked him why did he do that, and he said "Dogs don't feel anything." Hmm I wonder where did he learn how to punch dogs? My aunt told me that my sister and her boyfriend punch and kick their dogs whenever the dogs are misbehaving.




My oppressed relatives said that the white neighborhood Target stores sell better clothing styles. However, I honestly believe my oppressed relatives avoid shopping in poor neighborhoods because they are disgusted by poor black people. They hate seeing people shopping in their pajamas, crackheads, the rude cashiers, the awful customer service, and disorganized isles.  That's why I don't shop at Walmart." My gay cousin told me "I don't shop at Walmart because the people who shop at Walmart are wretched."</p>

<p>Me, I am openly racist, but I feel at peace in ghetto neighborhoods, like I can finally be myself. For example, in a specific dollar store I have been, that is located in a low-income neighborhood, there is a cashier black woman who is always in a bad mood, she has a visible mental disorder. She is always yelling at all the customers. She yelled at me personally, she said "Next! Next! I said next! Hurry up! Do you want a bag? I said do you want a bag or not? Stop mumbling, speak louder. Here's your change, take it! Take your change already, you're too slow, hurry up! Next!" All day long she is yelling at customers. And it made me feel like I don't have to be perfect, because this bipolar woman is far from perfect, but she works harder than any person I've ever encountered. And every once in a while, her mood suddenly changes, and she suddenly becomes very happy. She said In rich white neighborhoods, rich white libtards are always looking at my clothes and feeling sorry for me just because I am mexican, these white libtards try so hard to not be racist, they don't realize feeling sorry for someone because of a skin color is condescending and racist. 
And the disorganized isles, I've never had an issue finding what I need, because I am not looking for useless things. The only disorganized isles are the clothing isles, everyone is obsessed about clothes. </p>

<p>My sister and her boyfriend, they have an entire shed filled with tools, everday there are opened and unopened amazon boxes on their living room couch, they have piles and piles of clothes and shoes, all of them are branded, they are obsessed with brands. They have two children, and they are obsessed with putting nice clothes on their children, like they are insecure. One time their 6 year old wanted light up sketcher shoes, and my sister and her boyfriend told him "Ew, those are ugly. Buy yourself some Nike or Adidas. Look at these other ones, these other ones are nice." Ever since then, I noticed their son has been obsessed with clothing too. It's so sad, he always wanted cartoon clothing, now he his obsessed with being cool, because his parents told him his style is ugly.</p>
