<h1>Taco Bell</h1>
<p>I was ordering food at Taco Bell. The Taco Bell employees were african-american. My food took a long time because the employees were distracted by the loud conversation they were having. One black man said to another black man "Haha and who was the longest relationship you've been in?" He replied "That's actually a funny story." He replied "What's her instagram?" He replied "I dated this woman for one entire year. There was just one problem, she didn't want sex, she wanted marriage." He replied "Haha I've been there before. And what did you do next? Did you lie to her?" He replied "She was the finest woman I ever laid eyes on. The instant I saw her, I knew I wanted to f**k her p***y. I sent her good morning and goodnight texts every day. I told her I wanted to marry her, and have kids with her. I brought her flowers and chocolates. I did all that cute s**t women love." He replied "You gotta do what you gotta do. That's cool. You had a classy woman and then you was f**king h**s on the side." He replied "I am telling you this woman was gorgeous. I didn't want to ruin my chances with her." He replied "Haha are you telling me you went one entire year without sex?!" He replied "Haha yes, and finally after one year together she finally let me f**k her. And that was it for me. The very next day, I messaged some h*es, and started cheating. I went one entire year without sex, it was worth it, I have her naked pictures and a sex tape if you wanna see." About 18 months later, that Taco Bell had shut down, and they built a Starbucks on top of it. I don't know if the employees had anything to do with it, but I rarely saw customers in that Taco Bell. On this particular day, there was only one other customer that I saw, it was a tall white man who seemed like he was on methamphetamine.</p> 


<h1>Stealing Amazon Packages</h1>
<p>My uncle and his latino friend both claim to be oppressed. My uncle's latino friend said "I've been racially profiled before. I was just walking at night to my grandmother's house and the cops frisked me." My racist aunt said to him "But look at how you're dressed. You look like a thug. You have tattoos." He replied "It shouldn't matter what I look like. I wasn't doing a crime. Why don't cops stop white people for driving in nice cars and wearing tuxedos if they might be doing white collar crimes?" One time my uncle said "They sent this amazon package to the wrong address. What should I do with it?" My uncle's same latino friend replied "F**k it, it was on your property, that means it's yours. They can't search your home without a warrant." My uncle replied "F**k it, if Amazon paid their employees better, we wouldn't be in this situation. Our neighbor can get a refund." They opened the box and it was an Amazon Fire Tablet. My uncle said "I wish they sent an iPad. This piece of s**t is only worth $50." And they kept it.</p>

<h1>Brutality</h1>
<p>I went to an adult school designed for remedial 16 to 24 year olds. In that school I met a 24 year old latino man. He always wore Doc Marten boots, Dickies work shorts, and an oversized hooded sweater. During lunch he rolled up his sleeves revealing his tattoos. When he walked, he swung his shoulders and arms like he was about to stomp on someone's face. One time he was yelling at his girlfriend during lunch break, and a teacher interrupted them, then he yelled at the teacher "I didn't do anything! I was just talking!" Then the teacher said something to him, and he put his hands in his pockets, stared at the floor, and obediently walked to class. One time he bragged about a pistol firearm he purchased. One time a white teacher was giving a speech about how white neighborhoods have more money, and ghetto neighborhoods have no money, so that is why everyone in our ghetto school is destined to fail in life. Everyone was getting very emotional. Students were sharing their stories about police brutality, racism, adversity. Then, that 24 year old latino man raised his hand and began sharing his own personal struggles. Before he finished his second sentence, our teacher interrupted him by saying "What are you doing? I didn't call on you to speak! I called the student beside you! Why are you always interrupting me? Just hurry up and get to the point! You're going off topic!" Then the 24 year old latino man's voice cracked, he was about to cry as he walked out of the class and yelled "You don't have to be f**king a*****e!" That day was weird. The teacher was rude to everyone. Everyone was emotional and angry. I was so annoyed how the teacher was saying stupid things like "We don't even have pencils for our students. How are we supposed to succeed without school supplies?" I don't know what the teacher was talking about because literally everyone I knew owned their own pencil, even there was a homeless student there, he owned a pen and pencil somehow. 

<p>So then that 24 year old latino man told me that he hates the police so much. He said wearing a spiffy uniform makes you feel superior. He told me he used to be addicted to methamphetamine, I asked him if he's ever been in a fist fight before, and he said "No. But one time, I was walking with my girlfriend at night, I had a crowbar in my jacket, going to deliver the crowbar to my friend's house. And out of nowhere a man walked up to my girlfriend, he flashed his d**k and started jacking off in front us. I hit him with my crowbar." His girlfriend replied "And it was back then when he was still addicted to meth, so he went all out beating this man on the floor. And he deserved it too because why they f**k was he doing that." So literally these people hate police brutality, but when a man flashes his private parts and starts masturbating in front of them, they don't think twice, they start fighting.</p>
