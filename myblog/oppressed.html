<h1>Taco Bell</h1>
<p>I was ordering food at Taco Bell. The Taco Bell employees were african-american. My food took a long time because the employees were distracted by the loud conversation they were having. One black man said to another black man "Haha and who was the longest relationship you've been in?" He replied "That's actually a funny story." He replied "What's her instagram?" He replied "I dated this woman for one entire year. There was just one problem, she didn't want sex, she wanted marriage." He replied "Haha I've been there before. And what did you do next? Did you lie to her?" He replied "She was the finest woman I ever laid eyes on. The instant I saw her, I knew I wanted to f**k her p***y. I sent her good morning and goodnight texts every day. I told her I wanted to marry her, and have kids with her. I brought her flowers and chocolates. I did all that cute s**t women love." He replied "You gotta do what you gotta do. That's cool. You had a classy woman and then you was f**king h**s on the side." He replied "I am telling you this woman was gorgeous. I didn't want to ruin my chances with her." He replied "Haha are you telling me you went one entire year without sex?!" He replied "Haha yes, and finally after one year together she finally let me f**k her. And that was it for me. The very next day, I messaged some h*es, and started cheating. I went one entire year without sex, it was worth it, I have her naked pictures and a sex tape if you wanna see." About 18 months later, that Taco Bell had shut down, and they built a Starbucks on top of it. I don't know if the employees had anything to do with it, but I rarely saw customers in that Taco Bell. On this particular day, there was only one other customer that I saw, it was a tall white man who seemed like he was on methamphetamine.</p> 


<h1>Stealing Amazon Packages</h1>
<p>My uncle and his latino friend both claim to be oppressed. My uncle's latino friend said "I've been racially profiled before. I was just walking at night to my grandmother's house and the cops frisked me." My racist aunt said to him "But look at how you're dressed. You look like a thug. You have tattoos." He replied "It shouldn't matter what I look like. I wasn't doing a crime. Why don't cops stop white people for driving in nice cars and wearing tuxedos if they might be doing white collar crimes?" One time my uncle said "They sent this amazon package to the wrong address. What should I do with it?" My uncle's same latino friend replied "F**k it, it was on your property, that means it's yours. They can't search your home without a warrant." My uncle replied "F**k it, if Amazon paid their employees better, we wouldn't be in this situation. Our neighbor can get a refund." They opened the box and it was an Amazon Fire Tablet. My uncle said "I wish they sent an iPad. This piece of s**t is only worth $50." And they kept it.</p>
