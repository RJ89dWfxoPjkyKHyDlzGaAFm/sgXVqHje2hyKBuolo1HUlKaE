<h1>Are They Oppressed?</h1>
<p>I was ordering food at Taco Bell. The Taco Bell employees were african-american men. My food was took a long time because I could hear their entire conversation. One black man said to another black man "Haha and who was the longest relationship you've been in?" He replied "It's a funny story, I dated a woman for one entire year." He replied "Let me see her photos." He replied "There was just one problem, she didn't want sex, she wanted marriage." He replied "Haha I've been there before. And what did you do next? Did you lie to her?" He replied "Yes. She was the finest woman I ever laid eyes on. The instant I saw her, I knew I wanted to f**k her p***y. I dated her. I sent her good morning and goodnight texts every day. I told her I wanted to marry her, and have kids with her. I brought her flowers and chocolates. I did all that cute s**t women love." He replied "Haha did you have a side h*e?" He replied "No. I am telling you this woman was gorgeous. I didn't ruin my chances with her." He replied "Haha are you telling me you went one entire year without sex?!" He replied "Haha. Yes. And finally after one year together she finally let me f**k her. And that was it for me. The very next day, I got a side h*e, and started cheating. I went one entire year without sex, it was worth it, I have her naked pictures if you wanna see."
