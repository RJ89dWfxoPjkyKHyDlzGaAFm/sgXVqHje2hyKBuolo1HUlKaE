<h1>Fentanyl Overdose</h1>
<p>George Floyd died from a fentanyl overdose. The only reason George Floyd swallowed those pills was the fear of being imprisoned for drug charges. 49,860 fatal opioid overdoses occured in the United States during 2019 <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7006a4.htm">1</a>.</span> Meanwhile, U.S. police murder on average 1,095 people per year <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="../mappingpoliceviolence.html">2</a>.</span> White Supremacy did not murder George Floyd. The War on Drugs murdered George Floyd.</p>

<h1>History of Overdoses</h1>
<p>Courtney Ross who was George Floyd's girlfriend, she described George Floyd's March 6, 2020 non-fatal overdose as "foam building in the corners of his mouth <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/kPLV3aBs3P4?t=2307">1</a> <a target="_blank" aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/kPLV3aBs3P4?t=3060">2</a></span> <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/kPLV3aBs3P4?t=3083">3</a>."</span> Similarly, on the date George Floyd died May 25, 2020, a police told George Floyd "You got foam around your mouth too <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/0gQYMBALDXc?t=384">4</a>."</span></p>

<p>During 2019, a police officer told George Floyd "Open your mouth! Spit out what you got! Spit out what you got, or I'm gonna tase you! <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/WQB-yWwREOk?t=48">5</a>"</span> According to the New York Times, George Floyd "told officers that he had swallowed several tablets of Percocet, a strong narcotic. He was taken to the hospital <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/us/george-floyds-prior-arrest-drug-use.html">6</a>."</span></p>

<h1>Dangerous Dosage</h1>
<p>The autopsy found 11 ng/mL of Fentanyl in George Floyd's blood <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hennepin.us/residents/public-safety/medical-examiner#news-releases">1</a>.</span> PubChem said this about fentanyl "profound respiratory depression generally occur at concentrations of 10-20 ng/mL <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3345#section=Drug-Tolerance&fullscreen=true">2</a>."</span> EMCDDA said this about fentanyl "Blood concentrations of approximately 7 ng/ml or greater have been associated with fatalities where poly-substance use was involved <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/fentanyl#pharmacology">3</a>."</span> The other psychoactive substances found in George Floyd's blood postmortem are Methamphetamine 19 ng/mL, Delta-9 THC 2.9 ng/mL, Cotinine positive, Caffeine positive. George Floyd had a fentanyl pill in his mouth <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/MneBxdT-OCI?t=17">4</a>,</span> and then George Floyd yelled "Ugh! I ate too many drugs! <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/0gQYMBALDXc?t=791">5</a>"</span></p>

<p>The fentanyl metabolite Norfentanyl 5.6 ng/mL was found in George Floyd's blood. This possibly suggests at one point George Floyd had fentanyl 16.6 ng/ml in his blood (11+5.6). However, the metabolite might be from fentanyl he ingested days ago.</p>

<p>In his 2020 arrest, Derek Chauvin is seen slowly walking in the background. A distance away from George Floyd, Derek Chauvin had not even once put a knee on George Floyd's neck as George Floyd said "When I start breathing, it's gonna go off on me <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/NjKjaCvXdf4?t=2406">6</a>."</span> George Floyd continued "I can't breathe mister officer." George Floyd was struggling to breathe, even though by this point no one had ever touched his neck.</p>

<h1>Addiction Destroys Lives</h1>
<p>Between 2019 and 2020, we are seeing the progression of George Floyd's drug addiction. During 2019, George Floyd wore a handsome attire along with stylish sunglasses, he carried his ID and a large wad of cash <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/s7reJpf-23o?t=174">1</a>.</span> During 2019, George Floyd did not resist arrest as he seated himself into the police car. During 2020, George Floyd wore a muscle shirt, he forgot his ID at home, though he gave the officer his real name, so he did not forget his ID on purpose. During 2020, the police found in George Floyd's pockets atleast a pipe and Newport cigarettes, both symbols of a worsened addiction. By May 25, 2020, George Floyd wasted all his money on drugs, now he resorted to counterfeit money. When your friends are drug dealers, counterfeit money is easy like purchasing drugs, and some drug dealers will give out free counterfeit money to drug addicts for testing. In George Floyd's death, we are not seeing a man afraid of police brutality. We are seeing a man afraid of himself or what he has become. George Floyd lost everything because of a drug addiction, and it cost him his own life. During 2020, George Floyd resisted arrest because he was afraid that if he went to prison, he would no longer have access to opioids.</p> 

<h1>How to Survive an Overdose</h1>
<p>Fentanyl is so dangerous that in 2018 The Guardian reported "Dark web dealers voluntarily ban deadly fentanyl <span aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/01/dark-web-dealers-voluntary-ban-deadly-fentanyl">1</a>."</span> Neogen Corporation said this about Fentanyl "You know a drug is bad when drug dealers won’t even supply it <span aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://www.neogen.com/neocenter/blog/tox-tuesday-dark-web-marketplace-begins-to-ban-fentanyl/">2</a>."</span> This viral video shows a married couple experiencing a non-fatal opioid overdose <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLYlgLkaDcw">3</a>.</span> The married couple survived when the Memphis Fire Department resuscitated them using the antidote Naloxone <span aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://time.com/life-after-opioid-addiction/">4</a>.</span> The married couple had ingested heroin in a nearby Walgreens bathroom, they maintained awareness enough to walk to a nearby bus stop where the heroin suddenly overtook them. In opioid overdoses, there can be a period where the victim seems normal. If George Floyd was overdosing, he seemed normal walking to the police car. This WorldStarHipHop.com video allegedly depicts two humans who seemingly had awareness enough to drive a car and begin pumping gas until a drug overtook them <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://worldstarhiphop.com/embed/147946">5</a>.</span></p>

<p>The paramedics never administered Naloxone to George Floyd <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/us/asphyxia.html">6</a>.</span></p>

<h1>Implicit Racism</h1>
<p>Maybe Derek Chauvin was unconsciously racist. One article said "People See Black Men as Larger, More Threatening Than Same-Sized White Men [..] Even black participants displayed this bias." The Implicit Association Test is a famous indicator of unconscious racial biases <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/selectatest.html">1</a>,</span> click where it says "Race IAT." Pew Research reported 74% of blacks are unconsciously racist <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2015/08/19/exploring-racial-bias-among-biracial-and-single-race-adults-the-iat/">2</a></span>, 73% of whites are unconsciously racist. Should we be angry at someone who is unconsciously racist?</p>

<h1>War on Drugs</h1>
<p>John Ehrlichman said "The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did. <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/">1</a>"</span></p>

<p>That quote is evidence that white supremacy created the War on Drugs. However, in the 1920s there was a prohibition of alcohol. The U.S. government denatured alcohol which killed over 10,000 people. In other words, the U.S. government killed white people who drank alcohol. The temperance movement began in 1743 as a religious movement on the sermons of John Wesley. Slavery ended in 1833, so the War on Drugs existed long ago before slavery was abolished. The War on Drugs exists because there are humans who truly believe that drugs turns people into criminals.</p>

<h1>Verdict</h1>
<p>The African-American @ChristianWalk1r said "Cops aren't shooting you because you're black, they are shooting you because [..] you're resisting arrest. <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ChristianWalk1r/status/1382026384806006785">1</a>"</span> Tony Timpa is a white man who died in the exact same manner that George Floyd died <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/02/us/dallas-police-body-cam-footage-captures-death/index.html">2</a>.</span> No one remembers Tony Timpa, because his skin color is white.</p>

<p>Derek Chauvin was found guilty of "second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter." Derek Chauvin is a murderer like a drunk driver is a murderer. If Derek Chauvin is racist, he would have been charged with a Hate Crime. I wrote this article in order to spite the social movement who is treating this like a Hate Crime.</p>
