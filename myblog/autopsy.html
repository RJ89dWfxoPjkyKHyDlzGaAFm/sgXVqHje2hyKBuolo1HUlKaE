<p>This is my opinion: Derek Chauvin did not murder George Floyd. The war on drugs murdered George Floyd. Obviously, George Floyd died from a fentantyl overdose. The only reason George Floyd swallowed those pills was his fear of being imprisoned for drug charges.</p>

<p>The police footage of George Floyd's death was analyzed very carefully, and it revealed George Floyd had what appears to be a fentanyl pill in his mouth <a target="_blank" aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MneBxdT-OCI">[1]</a>. George Floyd's autopsy found 11 ng/mL of Fentanyl in George Floyd's blood <a target="_blank" aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.hennepin.us/residents/public-safety/medical-examiner#news-releases:~:text=Floyd%2C%20George%20Perry%20%E2%80%94%20Autopsy%20report">[2]</a> . PubChem had this to say about fentanyl "profound respiratory depression generally occur at concentrations of 10-20 ng/mL <a target="_blank" aria-hidden="true" href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3345#section=Drug-Tolerance:~:text=depression%20generally%20occur%20at%20concentrations%20of%2010-20%20ng%2FmL">[3]</a>." EMCDDA had this to say about fentanyl "Blood concentrations of approximately 7 ng/ml or greater have been associated with fatalities where poly-substance use was involved <a target="_blank" aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/fentanyl#pharmacology:~:text=Blood%20concentrations%20of%20approximately%207%20ng%2Fml,fatalities%20where%20poly%2Dsubstance%20use%20was%20involved">[4]</a>." The other psychoactive substances found in George Floyd's blood postmortem are Methamphetamine 19 ng/mL, Delta-9 THC 2.9 ng/mL, Cotinine positive, Caffeine positive.</p>

<p>The 2019 bodycam, a police officer tells George Floyd "Open your mouth! Spit out what you got! Spit out what you got, or I'm gonna tase you! <a target="_blank" aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/WQB-yWwREOk?t=48">[1]</a>" When the police offer yelled "You ain't getting beat up! You're eating pills!" it was his attempt to inform George Floyd that excessive force was needed because George Floyd might die from swallowing those pills. It is believed George Floyd attempted to avoid a drug charge.</p>

<p>George Floyd survived a drug overdose on March 6, 2020 or 80 days prior to his own death <a target="_blank" aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/kPLV3aBs3P4?t=2307">[1]</a><a target="_blank" aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/kPLV3aBs3P4?t=3060">[2]</a>. Courtney Ross who was George Floyd's girlfriend, she described George Floyd's March 6, 2020 non-fatal overdose as"foam building in the corners of his mouth <a target="_blank" aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/0gQYMBALDXc?t=384">[2]</a>." Similarly, on the day George Floyd died, a police told George Floyd "You got foam around your mouth too <a target="_blank" aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/0gQYMBALDXc?t=384">[2]</a>."</p>

<p>The 2020 bodycam, Derek Chauvin is seen slowly walking in the background. A distance away from George Floyd, Derek Chauvin had not even once put a knee on George Floyd's neck as George Floyd said "When I start breathing, it's gonna go off on me <a target="_blank" aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/NjKjaCvXdf4?t=2406">[1]</a>." George Floyd continued "I can't breath mister officer." George Floyd was struggling to breath, even though by this point no one had ever touched his neck. </p>

<p>The fentanyl epidemic is an observed phenomenon. This viral video shows a married couple experiencing a non-fatal opioid overdose <a target="_blank" aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLYlgLkaDcw">[2]</a> The married couple survived because the Memphis Fire Department resuscitated them with the antidote Naloxone.<a href="https://time.com/life-after-opioid-addiction/">[3]</a> The married couple had ingested heroin in a nearby Walgreens bathroom, they mantained awareness enough to walk to a nearby bus stop where the heroin suddenly overtook them. In opioid overdoses, there can be a period where the victim seems normal. If George Floyd was overdosing, he seemed normal walking to the police car. This WorldStarHipHop.com video allgedly depicts two humans who seemingly had awareness enough to drive a car and begin pumping gas until a drug overtook them <a target="_blank" aria-hidden="true" href="https://worldstarhiphop.com/embed/147946">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>The non-psychoactive fentanyl metabolites Norfentanyl 5.6 ng/mL, and 4-ANPP 0.65 ng/ml were found in George Floyd's blood. The fentanyl metabolites possibly suggests at one point George Floyd had fentanyl 17.25 ng/ml in his blood (11+5.6+.65). However, the metabolites might be from fentanyl he ingested days ago.</p>
