<p>This is my opinion: The war on drugs murdered George Floyd. Derek Chauvin did not intentionally murder George Floyd. George Floyd died from a fentanyl overdose. The only reason George Floyd swallowed those pills was the fear of being imprisoned for drug charges. I never said Derek Chauvin did nothing wrong. I am raising awareness on the opioid epidemic which has taken more lives than police brutality. 49,860 fatal opioid overdoses occured in the United States during 2019 <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7006a4.htm">1</a>.</span> Meanwhile, U.S. police murder on average 1,095 people per year <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="../mappingpoliceviolence.html">2</a>.</span></p>

<h1>History of Overdoses</h1>
<p>Courtney Ross who was George Floyd's girlfriend, she described George Floyd's March 6, 2020 non-fatal overdose as "foam building in the corners of his mouth <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/kPLV3aBs3P4?t=2307">1</a> <a target="_blank" aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/kPLV3aBs3P4?t=3060">2</a></span> <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/kPLV3aBs3P4?t=3083">3</a>."</span> Similarly, on May 25, 2020 the date George Floyd died, a police told George Floyd "You got foam around your mouth too <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/0gQYMBALDXc?t=384">4</a>."</span></p>

<p>During 2019, a police officer told George Floyd "Open your mouth! Spit out what you got! Spit out what you got, or I'm gonna tase you! <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/WQB-yWwREOk?t=48">1</a>"</span> According to the New York Times, George Floyd "told officers that he had swallowed several tablets of Percocet, a strong narcotic. He was taken to the hospital <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/us/george-floyds-prior-arrest-drug-use.html">2</a>."</span></p>

<h1>Dangerous Dosage</h1>
<p>In his 2020 arrest, George Floyd had a fentanyl pill in his mouth <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/MneBxdT-OCI?t=17">1</a>,</span> and then George Floyd yelled "Ugh! I ate too many drugs! <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/0gQYMBALDXc?t=791">3</a>"</span> The autopsy found 11 ng/mL of Fentanyl in George Floyd's blood <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hennepin.us/residents/public-safety/medical-examiner#news-releases">2</a>.</span> PubChem said this about fentanyl "profound respiratory depression generally occur at concentrations of 10-20 ng/mL <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3345#section=Drug-Tolerance&fullscreen=true">3</a>."</span> EMCDDA said this about fentanyl "Blood concentrations of approximately 7 ng/ml or greater have been associated with fatalities where poly-substance use was involved <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/fentanyl#pharmacology">4</a>."</span> The other psychoactive substances found in George Floyd's blood postmortem are Methamphetamine 19 ng/mL, Delta-9 THC 2.9 ng/mL, Cotinine positive, Caffeine positive.</p>

<p>The fentanyl metabolite Norfentanyl 5.6 ng/mL was found in George Floyd's blood. This possibly suggests at one point George Floyd had fentanyl 16.6 ng/ml in his blood (11+5.6). However, the metabolite might be from fentanyl he ingested days ago.</p>

<p>In his 2020 arrest, Derek Chauvin is seen slowly walking in the background. A distance away from George Floyd, Derek Chauvin had not even once put a knee on George Floyd's neck as George Floyd said "When I start breathing, it's gonna go off on me <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/NjKjaCvXdf4?t=2406">1</a>."</span> George Floyd continued "I can't breathe mister officer." George Floyd was struggling to breathe, even though by this point no one had ever touched his neck.</p>

<h1>Addiction Destroys Lives</h1>
<p>Between 2019 and 2020, we are seeing the progression of George Floyd's drug addiction. During 2019, George Floyd wore a handsome attire along with stylish sunglasses, he carried his ID and a large wad of cash <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/s7reJpf-23o?t=174">1</a>.</span> During 2019, George Floyd did not resist arrest as he seated himself into the police car. During 2020, George Floyd was wearing a muscle shirt, he forgot his ID at home, though he gave the officer his real name, so he did not forget his ID on purpose. During 2020, the police found in George Floyd's pockets atleast a pipe and Newport cigarettes, both symbols of a worsened addiction. By May 25, 2020, George Floyd wasted all his money on drugs, now he resorted to counterfeit money. When your friends are drug dealers, counterfeit money is easy like purchasing drugs, and some drug dealers will give out free counterfeit money to drug addicts for testing. In George Floyd's death, we are not seeing a man afraid of police brutality. We are seeing a man afraid of himself or what he has become. George Floyd lost everything because of a drug addiction, and it cost him his own life. During 2020, George Floyd resisted arrest because he was afraid that if he went to prison, he would no longer have access to opioids.</p> 

<h1>How to Survive an Overdose</h1>
<p>Fentanyl is so dangerous that in 2018 The Guardian reported "Dark web dealers voluntarily ban deadly fentanyl <span aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/01/dark-web-dealers-voluntary-ban-deadly-fentanyl">1</a>."</span> Neogen Corporation said this about Fentanyl "You know a drug is bad when drug dealers wonâ€™t even supply it <span aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://www.neogen.com/neocenter/blog/tox-tuesday-dark-web-marketplace-begins-to-ban-fentanyl/">2</a>."</span> This viral video shows a married couple experiencing a non-fatal opioid overdose <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLYlgLkaDcw">3</a>.</span> The married couple survived when the Memphis Fire Department resuscitated them using the antidote Naloxone <span aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://time.com/life-after-opioid-addiction/">4</a>.</span> The married couple had ingested heroin in a nearby Walgreens bathroom, they maintained awareness enough to walk to a nearby bus stop where the heroin suddenly overtook them. In opioid overdoses, there can be a period where the victim seems normal. If George Floyd was overdosing, he seemed normal walking to the police car. This WorldStarHipHop.com video allegedly depicts two humans who seemingly had awareness enough to drive a car and begin pumping gas until a drug overtook them <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://worldstarhiphop.com/embed/147946">5</a>.</span></p>
