<p>This is my opinion: Derek Chauvin did not intentionally murder George Floyd. The war on drugs murdered George Floyd. Obviously, George Floyd died from a fentanyl overdose. The only reason George Floyd swallowed those pills was his fear of being imprisoned for drug charges. I am not saying that Derek Chauvin did nothing wrong. I am raising awareness on the opioid epidemic which has taken more lives than police brutality. 49,860 fatal opioid overdoses occured in the United States during 2019 <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7006a4.htm">[1]</a>.</span> Meanwhile, U.S. police murder on average 1,095 people per year <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="../mappingpoliceviolence.html">[2]</a>.</span></p>

<p>The police footage of George Floyd's death was analyzed very carefully, and it revealed George Floyd had what appears to be a fentanyl pill in his mouth <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/MneBxdT-OCI?t=17">[1]</a>.</span> The autopsy found 11 ng/mL of Fentanyl in George Floyd's blood <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hennepin.us/residents/public-safety/medical-examiner#news-releases">[2]</a>.</span> PubChem had this to say about fentanyl "profound respiratory depression generally occur at concentrations of 10-20 ng/mL <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3345#section=Drug-Tolerance&fullscreen=true">[3]</a>."</span> EMCDDA had this to say about fentanyl "Blood concentrations of approximately 7 ng/ml or greater have been associated with fatalities where poly-substance use was involved <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/fentanyl#pharmacology">[4]</a>."</span> The other psychoactive substances found in George Floyd's blood postmortem are Methamphetamine 19 ng/mL, Delta-9 THC 2.9 ng/mL, Cotinine positive, Caffeine positive.</p>

<p>George Floyd survived a drug overdose on March 6, 2020 or 80 days prior to his own death <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/kPLV3aBs3P4?t=2307">[1]</a> <a target="_blank" aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/kPLV3aBs3P4?t=3060">[2]</a>.</span> Courtney Ross who was George Floyd's girlfriend, she described George Floyd's March 6, 2020 non-fatal overdose as "foam building in the corners of his mouth <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/kPLV3aBs3P4?t=3083">[3]</a>."</span> Similarly, on the day George Floyd died, a police told George Floyd "You got foam around your mouth too <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/0gQYMBALDXc?t=384">[4]</a>."</span></p>

<p>In the 2019 arrest, a police officer tells George Floyd "Open your mouth! Spit out what you got! Spit out what you got, or I'm gonna tase you! <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/WQB-yWwREOk?t=48">[1]</a>"</span> When the police officer yelled "You ain't getting beat up! You're eating pills!" it was his attempt to inform George Floyd that excessive force was needed or else George Floyd might die from swallowing those pills. According to the New York Times, in his 2019 arrest George Floyd "told officers that he had swallowed several tablets of Percocet, a strong narcotic. He was taken to the hospital <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/us/george-floyds-prior-arrest-drug-use.html">[2]</a>."</span> And so George Floyd had an extensive history of being hospitalized for drug overdoses. In his 2020 arrest, George Floyd yelled "Ugh! I ate too many drugs! <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/0gQYMBALDXc?t=791">[3]</a>"</span></p>

<p>Let's analyze the differences between the 2019 arrest versus the 2020 arrest. In the 2019 arrest, George Floyd is wearing a handsome sweater, pants, shoes, along with stylish sunglasses, he carried his ID with him, and the police found a large wad of cash inside George Floyd's pocket <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/s7reJpf-23o?t=174">[1]</a>.</span> In the 2019 arrest, George Floyd was not resisting arrest as he seated himself into the police car. In the 2020 arrest, George Floyd was wearing a muscle shirt, he forgot his ID at home, though he gave the officer his real name, so he did not forget his ID on purpose. In the 2020 arrest, the police found in George Floyd's pockets atleast a pipe, Newport cigarettes, and a plastic card which might be an EBT card. By May 25, 2020, I think George Floyd had so little money that he resorted to counterfeit money. Between the 2019 and 2020 arrests, we see the progression of George Floyd's drug addiction. In the video of George Floyd's death, we are NOT seeing a man who is afraid of police brutality, instead what we are seeing is a man who is afraid of himself and what he has become, what we are seeing is a man named George Floyd who lost everything because of a drug addiction. In the 2020 arrest, George Floyd resisted arrest because he was afraid that if he went to prison, he would no longer have access to drugs.</p> 
<p>The 2020 bodycam, Derek Chauvin is seen slowly walking in the background. A distance away from George Floyd, Derek Chauvin had not even once put a knee on George Floyd's neck as George Floyd said "When I start breathing, it's gonna go off on me <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/NjKjaCvXdf4?t=2406">[1]</a>."</span> George Floyd continued "I can't breathe mister officer." George Floyd was struggling to breathe, even though by this point no one had ever touched his neck.</p>

<p>The fentanyl epidemic is an observed phenomenon. Fentanyl is so dangerous that in 2018 The Guardian reported "Dark web dealers voluntarily ban deadly fentanyl <span aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/01/dark-web-dealers-voluntary-ban-deadly-fentanyl">[1]</a>."</span> Neogen Corporation said this about Fentanyl "You know a drug is bad when drug dealers wonâ€™t even supply it <span aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://www.neogen.com/neocenter/blog/tox-tuesday-dark-web-marketplace-begins-to-ban-fentanyl/">[2]</a>."</span> This viral video shows a married couple experiencing a non-fatal opioid overdose <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLYlgLkaDcw">[3]</a>.</span> The married couple survived because the Memphis Fire Department resuscitated them with the antidote Naloxone <span aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://time.com/life-after-opioid-addiction/">[4]</a>.</span> The married couple had ingested heroin in a nearby Walgreens bathroom, they maintained awareness enough to walk to a nearby bus stop where the heroin suddenly overtook them. In opioid overdoses, there can be a period where the victim seems normal. If George Floyd was overdosing, he seemed normal walking to the police car. This WorldStarHipHop.com video allegedly depicts two humans who seemingly had awareness enough to drive a car and begin pumping gas until a drug overtook them <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://worldstarhiphop.com/embed/147946">[5]</a>.</span></p>

<p>The fentanyl metabolite Norfentanyl 5.6 ng/mL was found in George Floyd's blood. This possibly suggests at one point George Floyd had fentanyl 16.6 ng/ml in his blood (11+5.6). However, the metabolite might be from fentanyl he ingested days ago.</p>
