<p>Jane was a popular video live streamer on MeetMe. Jane often talked about her own job, she was a cashier for Trader Joe's. One day a mysterious man joined Jane's livestream, he never sent a single word to Jane, he only sent Jane one lurking eyes emoji "ðŸ‘€" to Jane a few times per week. It is unclear whether Jane blocked this mysterious man, or if this mysterious man kept making new accounts. One night Jane finished her shift at Trader Joe's. Jane exited the Trader Joe's, she walked towards her car. Suddenly, a man approached Jane. Jane was very afraid. The man said "Hello, Jane. I am that man who always sends you the lurking eyes emoji, isn't that quite hilarious? I brought this bouquet of flowers for you. Would you like to go on a date with me?" Jane replied "How did you find me?!" He replied "I knew you worked at Trader Joe's. I googled every Trader Joe's in our state, I went to all of them."</p>

<p>Jane was telling that story publicly on her livestream, that was how I heard it, and Jane continued "It turns out my stalker was a very polite man. He suffers from a mental disorder called Autism which made him unaware of social boundaries. His Autism made him believe that his actions were romantic. I told him it's wrong to do those things. He was very thankful for the advice I gave him."</p>

<p>I rarely watched Jane's livestreams. But I remember one in particular, it was on July 4, 2019. I remember it because Jane was in a really happy mood. Jane toasted a grilled cheese sandwich in a compact electric oven. Jane described exotic cheeses, and exotic spices, that I had never heard of. Jane returned to her bedroom, that was where I saw Jane's black cat who had white paws. Jane also owned a rabbit. Jane hugged her cat and she said "I love you." Jane patted her rabbit. Jane announced "I will return later." Jane ended her livestream. One hour later, Jane started her livestream again. This time Jane was wearing a red, white, and blue outfit like Harley Quinn. It was the American Independence holiday theme. Jane asked her viewers "Should I use red lipstick or blue lipstick?" Jane said "Boyfriend, can you please videochat me right now?" Suddenly, I saw Jane's tanned boyfriend video chatting with Jane. Jane asked her boyfriend "Can I please go out to the club by myself?" Suddenly, I had anxiety wondering what would happen if Jane's boyfriend said no and Jane might have worn her fancy outfit and makeup for nothing. Jane's boyfriend replied "Yes, you may go." Jane and her boyfriend were a long distance interstate relationship.</p>

<p>Next week, I saw Jane's livestream again. Jane said "I might stop livestreaming soon. I am moving out of my parent's home, and I will begin study at a college." On January 2020, I observed Jane's profile was completely nonexistent, deleted, gone.</p>

<p>On April 2021, I found a MeetMe streamer named "Jane Spectacular." I joined Jane Spectacular's livestream, and I said to her "OMG I totally recognize you from a long time ago!" This new Jane replied "I used to be a very popular streamer on MeetMe two years ago. Several others recognized me too. This is my new profile." I asked Jane "Can I please videochat with you, I am confused right now, so I will ask you a few questions to verify your identity." I started video chatting with Jane, but Jane's wifi was lagging, so she could not see my face, she only heard my voice, and this was extremely inconvenient for me, because then I asked her "Do you have a black cat with white paws? And do you have a rabbit?" Jane replied "When I lived with my parents, I had a black cat with whites paws, and I had a rabbit. I don't have any photos of my pets online. So you have the right Jane." I replied "A few minutes ago, you told us you love scary stories. A long time ago, you told me the scariest story that I ever heard. You told us that a mysterious man occassionally sent you the lurking eyes emoji." I paused and I waited for Jane to speak, she said nothing. I continued "Then, one day he showed up at your work." I paused again, Jane said nothing, I continued "You said he had Autism." Jane finally spoke "In my life I had several stalker encounters. I did have a stalker show up at my job, when I worked at Trader Joe's. But I don't know about the lurking eyes emoji nor the autism. I think you have the wrong Jane." I replied "Yes! I didn't want to say Trader Joe's because of obvious reasons!" At this point Jane's livestream comments were already saying "Block him, he is a total creep!" Another commented "Imagine seeing this creep in a parking lot, yikes!" Another commented "If a man asks you in a parking lot 'Do I know you from somewhere?' Run fast." Jane announced "I can't see his face because my app is glitching." I replied "This is extremely inconvenient that you can't see my face right now, because now it is seeming as if I might be the Trader Joe's stalker. But if you could see my face, you would know I am not him." Jane announced "I don't think he is a creep. I think he genuinely has the wrong Jane." I replied "When you are sober, let me know if you suddenly remember the details of this story, because I want to write your stalker story on my website." Jane replied "I am sober! Are you being rude to me?" I replied "Several minutes ago you told us 'Fuck it, I guess I am going to work drunk in a few hours.' And you're sipping on vodka right now." Jane replied "And? So what? That is nothing. You're being really rude right now." I attempted to convey my sympathy that she might be in denial of her own alcoholism as I replied "I apologize and I understand we all have problems." Jane replied "Fuck you! I don't have problems! You're being really rude to me right now, I am seconds away from blocking you!" I replied "I really do apologize. Thank you. I am exiting this." I exited Jane's video chat. Jane restarted her livestream, and suddenly she stopped lagging, her app wasn't glitching anymore. Jane drank her vodka, and then Jane announced "My ex-boyfriend cheated on me. I was the best girlfriend. I gave him everything. I purchased gifts for him. Everything he told was a lie."I replied "I believe your exboyfriend is named Enrique?" Jane replied "No, his name is Ricky. You have the wrong Jane." I replied "Enrique and Ricky are interchangeable names." Jane replied "Let me show you what Ricky did to me. Do you see this smudge on the wall? That's Ricky's blood. I scratched him. There are times when I feel very strong emotions which I cannot express in words, and that's when I punch people. I keep my gun in my car. I don't trust any man. I don't believe any of their lies. What Ricky did to me, it is so fucked up." I replied "Since your app is not glitching anymore, may I video chat with you so we can verify that you have never seen my face, therefore I can prove that I am not the Trader Joe's stalker." Jane replied "No, that's not helpful. You just have the wrong Jane." Jane's moderator told me "Jovanny, send me your website or else you're a creep." I replied "My website is political, you might get offended." The moderator replied "You're all lies, you're a creep, you don't have a website, you've been stalking Jane all these years haven't you?" I sent him my website, and immediately Jane's livestream ended. I thought they banned me, but I checked, and I am not banned.</p>

<p>This is not the same Jane that I remembered. The Jane I remember, she was very intelligent, feminine, affectionate, loving, and caring. This new Jane Spectacular is unintelligent, masculine, bitter, hateful, and regressed. There is a chance I am confusing two different Janes together. But their physical appearances are VERY similar, and their stories are very similar too. In this paragraph, I want to include the following evidence: Jane Spectaular told us "I want to wear a lace shirt right now, but I might get banned so nevermind. I love dressing up like Harley Quinn." The Jane I remember dressed up like Harley Quinn on 4th of July holiday. However, plenty of women dress up like Harley Quinn. Jane Spectacular's bio says "cooking is one of my expertises." The Jane I remember had knowledge about exotic cheeses, and exotic spices when she baked a grilled cheese sandwich. However, plenty of women write about cooking in their bio. The Jane I remember had a boyfriend named Enrique, but my memory is very uncertain about this, I somewhat remember he was a tanned hispanic man, if his name was Ricky, my brain turned it into Enrique an interchangeable name.</p>

<p>Honestly, truly this is what I believe. I believe I found the same Jane two years later. But something happened to Jane within those two years since I last saw her that she moved out of her parent's house, she lost body weight, went through an abusive relationship, started doing drugs and alcohol, developed a butch style, got tattoos, purchased a gun. Her personality drastically changed. Her new personality is unrecognizable. I guess this is the story of Jane, a small town girl who moves to the big city.</p>

<p>Practically every time I tell this story, my listeners always think I am the Trader Joe's stalker. I am not. I am just a man who loves collecting great stories. I am a great listener, I have a journalistic personality because of my devotion to my blog. I want to write this story on my blog to help people not make the same mistake that Jane did. This is a true story, you can even go to the Trader Joe's website to see a list of every Trader Joe's locations <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://locations.traderjoes.com/">[1]</a></span>. However, the real person is not named Jane, I obfuscated Jane's real name to protect her privacy. This stalker story fits my political agenda because #BlackLivesMatter women feel like they are afraid of the police, but in truth are most afraid of exboyfriends and stalkers. This story is also about how drugs, alcohol, culture shock, and trauma changes the personality of humans.</p>

<p>The CDC said "Nearly 1 in 6 women (16.0%, or 19.1 million) in the U.S. were victims of stalking at some point in their lifetime, during which she felt very fearful or believed that she or someone close to her would be harmed or killed <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nisvs/summaryreports.html">[2]</a></span>
