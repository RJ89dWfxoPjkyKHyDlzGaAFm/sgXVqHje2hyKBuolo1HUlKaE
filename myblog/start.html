<p>Everything that you will read on my website is my attempt to propagandize you into believing in Atheism and Predeterminism.</p>

<p>My favorite atheism quote is by Thomas Edison "He also made the fish I catch and eat. And where do His mercy, kindness, and love for that fish come in? <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="../thomasedison.html">1</a>"</span></p>

<p>My favorite Predeterminism evidence is Benjamin Libet's experiment <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/lmI7NnMqwLQ?t=838">2</a>.</span> Interestingly, Benjamin Libet himself believed his experiment proved the existence of Free-Won't. In my opinion, Free-Won't is incorrect. Only humans with a sufficiently formed frontal lobe have adequate impulse control. The 3 types of Wills are Free-Will, Free-Won't, and Predeterminism. Here are examples of each based on homosexuality. And simply replace "homosexuality" with anything such as "overeating, depression, laziness, criminality." I chose homosexuality as the example because libtards gladly accept the theory that homosexuality is not a choice. But when it comes to crime, libtards think crime is always a choice.</p> </p>

<p>Free-Will: I made the educated decision to be straight. There is no such thing as a gay gene. Gay is a choice. If you are gay it's because you were raised in a gay household or you were influenced by gay propaganda in the media.</p>

<p>Free-Won't: I acknowledge there are biological mechanisms that makes certain humans more likely to do homosexual acts. As humans, we can't control our emotions, but we have complete control over our behavior. The human spirit allows us to veto the impulses of the human flesh, and so we control our own destiny.</p>

<p>Predeterminism: The universe is not infinite. We know the universe is 13.8 billion years old. We know the universe's size is 93 billion light years in diameter. If we acknowledge the exact position and momentum of every particle in this universe, then we could predict any past, present, and future event. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle suggests it might be impossible to know the exact position and momentum of a particle, however Albert Einstein responded "God does not play dice with the universe." That quote means quantum mechanics is seemingly random, but somewhere in that randomness there is a math equation we haven't realized yet. Albert Einstein changed his quote to "God tirelessly plays dice under laws which he has himself prescribed <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.livescience.com/65697-einstein-letters-quantum-physics.html">3</a>."</span> This updated quote means there is a math equation within quantum mechanics that only God himself is capable of understanding, and mortal humans may never be able to reverse engineer it, this is a "one-way function <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://philosopherdeveloper.com/posts/universe-is-a-one-way-function.html">4</a>."</span> Thomas Edison said "it is the cells which seem to have the intelligence." Human consciousness is made of brain cells. The cells controls the human consciousness, but we can't control the individual cells. Life is like a book written in a language called mathematics, every character believes they can alter certain events, but no matter what each character says, does, or believes, they are destined to behave exactly as the book is written. Think about your favorite movie, no matter how many times you watch it over and over, it always ends the same though each character seems oblivious. Whether you seemingly decide to be gay or not be gay, it was meant to be that way, and no one knows why. If you believe in God, it means God doesn't make mistakes, He had a plan from the very beginning, like we are here to be taught a lesson. Albert Einstein said "Everything is determined, the beginning as well as the end, by forces over which we have no control. It is determined for the insect as well as for the star. Human beings, vegetables, or cosmic dust, we all dance to a mysterious tune, intoned in the distance by an invisible piper <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Einstein/gchgl_XLqI0C?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=Everything%20is%20determined%2C&pg=PT477&printsec=frontcover">5</a>."</span></p>

<p>Free-Will: Criminals are shaped by their environment.</p>
<p>Free-Won't: Some humans are biologically susceptible to do crime, but the human spirit is the ultimate decision maker.</p>
<p>Predeterminism: God has already decided what you will become, he created both your environment and your nurture.</p>

<p>I noticed that every political argument is always fundamentally about Free-Will and God. The significance of Free-Will is it decides your belief in rewards and punishment systems. The more you believe in Free-Will, the more you believe in reward and punishment. For example,</p>

<p>Free-Will: Everyone born equal. There is no such thing as a billionaire gene. I am a billionaire because I earned it through my hard work and perseverance. If you are homeless, that means you are lazy, and since you are lazy that means you don't deserve to be a billionaire. I have no compassion for the homeless.</p>

<p>Free-Won't: Some are born unequal. I was born with a disability, but I learned how to live with my disability, I overcame homelessness, and today I am a billionaire because I earned it through my hard work and perseverence. If you set your mind to it, you can achieve anything. Homeless people are just stuck in that negative mindset. But I have compassion for the homeless because I understand how hard it is to fight those negative thoughts.</p>

<p>Predeterminism: Billionaires just got lucky. Homeless just got unlucky. That means billionaires and homeless are both equal.</p>

<p>So when you believe in Free-Will, you also believe that you could correct any behavior by utilizing reward & punishment, re-education camps and torture methods. Since you believe everyone is biologically equal, then the only difference between one human and the next must be their internal monologues called mindesets. Criminals adopted a bad mindset. And where did that bad mindset originate? Criminals learned from other criminals by reading manifestos. And so in order to prevent crime, you need to fight propaganda, deplatform.</p>

<p>When you stop believing in Free-Will, you realize humans are not biologically equal, but all humans are equally deserving of love and compassion. Some humans are born to be a permanent criminal. Some are born to be a temporary criminal. Identify those permanent criminals, and remove them from society. Identify those temporary criminals, and teach them the error of their ways.</p>

<p>A famous pre-deterministic quote is the Serenity Prayer "God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference."</p>

<p>The meaning of life is humanity is supposed to technologically evolve until we invent a machine that will one day destroy the entire universe. By destroying the universe, we end all suffering <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/solve-suffering-by-blowing-up-the-universe-the-dubious-philosophy-of-human-extinction-149331">6</a>.</span> It is not enough to destroy our own planet, because there might be other animals suffering in the other galaxies. Hopefully, we will not destroy the universe with an explosion, but rather we will exploit some scientific property of the universe. For example, scientists wrote a safety review and wondered if the Large Hadron Collider might destory the planet Earth or even destory our entire universe. The Large Hadron Collider did not destroy us, but in the future there might be a scientific experiment that could. Elon Musk and Sam Altman refer to this as an exiting of the "simulation." Although, I don't believe in the simulation hypothesis.</p>
