<p>When I was a young adult, I was involved in a car accident. Here is that story.</p>

<h1>The Accident</h1>
<p>I was my uncle's passenger, my uncle was driving. The person who crashed us was a black man driver with a white woman passenger. The accident was caused because the black man was speeding through a red signal. There was a train crossing bar as proof that me and my uncle had the right-of-way.</p>

<h1>A Suspicious Detail</h1>
<p>The crazy fact is, a few months previous, my uncle was involved in a different car accident. No one crashed him. He said it was completely his own fault. His car flipped upside down, he became unconscious, and was sent to a hospital. It's so crazy that my uncle was in two car accidents within the same year. On the day of our accident, my uncle said to me "My plan is I am quitting alcohol for one year, then if I survive one year without alcohol, I will start drinking alcohol again. These past months I've been sober."</p> 

<h1>Were They On Drugs?</h1>
<p>When the accident occurred, the white woman exited her vehicle and yelled "Oh no, my baby! Oh no, my baby!" The black man said to me and my uncle "Don't worry about her. We don't have a baby. She is not pregnant. She is mentally not okay." The white woman started opening and closing different doors of her car, it seemed like she was anxiously searching for gold. My uncle said to me "Oh definitely, they were both on drugs."</p> 

<h1>The Tow Truck</h1>

<p>The tow driver was a black man, and his passenger was a latino man. The latino man and my uncle immediately recognized each other as former High School friends. The latino man said to my uncle "Aye what up homie how you been? It's been a long time." That was how the black driver trusted my uncle. The black man gave my uncle a business card and said to my uncle "Call this number, tell them your back hurts, and you each get $3,000. So that adds up to $6,000." I was so naive that I asked "What if my back doesn't hurt? Mine feels fine." Suddenly, the black man got very angry and scoffed at me "Do you know what is whiplash? It means you will feel the pain in one or two years from today. These people caused you an inconvenience. You are entitled to a compensation." Everyone in the tow truck instructed me to just do whatever my uncle tells me to do. My uncle said "I'll do all the talking from now on, you keep your mouth shut." So that is what I did. I let my uncle do all the talking. My uncle was older than me, I believed automatically that made him more knowledgeable.</p>

<h1>The Repair Shop</h1>
<p>The tow truck dropped me, my uncle, and our damaged car off at an auto body repair shop where all the employees were latinos. They were eager to push us out of there. They had the paper work ready. The employee said "Don't worry about anything. Sign these documents. The insurance will pay for everything. You just had a traumatic experience. An Uber is on it's way for you, free of charge." And just like that my uncle and I were out of there in less than 20 minutes. We mostly waited for the Uber driver.</p>

<h1>The Attorney</h1>
<p>At the chiropractor, we were greeted by a black man wearing a tuxedo, fedora hat, and briefcase. The black man said to us "Give me your social security and identification cards." I gave him my social security, and I replied "I forgot my identification card at home." Suddenly, the black man scoffed at me "How old are you? You're a grown man. Get your s**t together." The black man returned to his happy demeanor. It was scary, like he accidentally exposed his true self. His true self was evil. His happy demeanor was a facade.</p> 

<h1>Chiropractor</h1>
<p>The chiropractor was a black man with expressionless eyes. He instructed us to lay down on a vibrating platform. It was a rusty metal table with a pillow on it. The black man instructed me to press the button. That was the moment I realized what was happening. This was an elaborate scam. This vibrating table does nothing except make a lot of noise. There was no way this machine helped anyone. It wasn't designed to fix anything. The coin operated machines at shopping centers are more useful than this rusty old vibrating table.</p>

<h1>My Anxiety</h1>
<p>I started panicking while reading internet articles about how auto insurance works. When I had enough information to form an argument, I then confronted my entire family. I described my theories and asked for their opinions. I was nervous and panicking. This is what I said to my family memmbers "They are not your average criminals, these one are organized. I believe they are stealing our identities as we speak. The tow driver receives a commission. The repair shop is scamming us with these impound fees. This is stealing $30,000. The attorney and chiropractor each takes 33%. We only get $10,000. The tow driver said it was $6,000. Our car is worth $7,000. We can do this the legal way. An insurance would rather pay $7,000 than $30,000."</p>

<h1>Reality Hit Me</h1>
<p>This is how my family reponded to my theories. My uncle said "Relax, don't over think things. Insurance fraud is the oldest trick in the book. And the best part is everything is untraceable. No one could tell that your spine doesn't hurt." My sister and her boyfriend both told me "We must always take advantage of this opportunity to steal from white people. White people are stealing from all of us. White people stole this country from the native americans. They never paid reparations to black people. They put japanese people in concentration camps. The prison industrial complex. Crack-Cocaine. $30,000 sounds sounds like a lot to you. Its nothing for white people. They have lamborghinis and mansions." My mother said "I have enough problems of my own."</p>

<p>My father said "You gotta play your cards right." I replied to my father "Do you remember when I was a kid, I distracted you while you were driving, you accidentally hit bumpers with the car in front of us. It was nothing, his rear bumper fell off, and that was it, his car was perfectly fine. Years later, I was a teenager, I asked you what happened, and you told me the person exaggerated the damages and so your insurance cost increased." My father replied "That's how life works when you don't play your cards right. I didn't play my cards right, my eyes should've been on the road, which I paid my dues for it. I was a loser back then. Now I am a winner."</p>

<p>I was all alone in this world realizing my family was a bunch of crooks, con artists, and fraudsters.</p>

<h1>My Neighbor's Accident</h1>
<p>My neighbor was involved in a car accident. My neighbor was a latina mother living with her daughter. I had always known them to be good people with outstanding morals. They moved to this country, survived hardships, sexual abuse, and racism. Now they had two brand new cars, the latest macbooks, the latest iPhones, the daughter went to a university through DACA. I explained my own experiences about insurance fraud to them. I assumed we were all on the same opinon that insurance fraud is bad. In the middle of my story, the latina mother interrupted me and said to her daughter in spanish "You see, it's easy what I am telling you to do. Please listen to me. We must take advantage of this situation. I love you so much, my daughter I want you to have a better life. If we don't do this, they will take advantage of us because of our skin color." Suddenly, I realized we were not on the same opinion. My mother said "The mother recently sued her employer for worker's compensation. Every job she's had, she has found a way to sue." My mother knows because she talks to them, and one time we saw the mother in crutches. One time the animal control appeared at my home, within seconds my latina neighbor's mother was out here with her latest iPhone, she started video recording the animal control, she said "Are you a police? Let me see your badge?"</p>

<h1>My Aunt's Accidents</h1>
<p>My aunt parallel parked between two cars. She ran to the store. When my aunt returned, she accidentally hit bumpers with the car behind her. A black man told her "It's okay, it's probably nothing. As a precaution, we should exchange insurance details." My aunt agreed. Then, a few days or weeks later, my aunt recieved an insurance letter in the mail. That was how she realized she got scammed. The black man did it on purpose. When he saw my aunt running to the store, he parked his car extremely close to my aunt's car on purpose. The black man exagerrated the damages, and so my aunt's monthly insurance cost increased. We saw a photo of the damages he claimed. My aunt hit his bumper, but the photo showed the hood of his car was bent. It's literally impossible to hit a bumper and damage the hood like that. It looked like he damaged his own car with a baseball bat. My aunt said "He seemed like a very nice old man. I was so stupid." Then, my aunt told me "When I was an undergraduate student, I accidentally crashed someone's bumper and it fell off. It was a white husband and white wife. They said to me 'Don't worry about it. It was an honest mistake. You are a very friendly latina woman going to college. You have a whole life ahead of you,' and they let me go."</p> 

<h1>Another Scam</h1>
<p>My grandmother's refrigerator was leaking water. The latino repair man carried the refrigerator to his shop. The repair man gave us a cheap estimate. He fixed our refrigerator, and he delivered it my grandmother's home. Then out of nowhere the latino repair man gave us a way more expensive estimate. He said "My previous estimate was the cost for the repair. I am now charging extra because I shipped and delivered the refrigerator myself." Then my uncle said "No. That is not what we agreed on." The repair man said "Well, if you don't want to pay me, I will just call the police." While they were arguing, the repair man said "There is a component in this refrigerator, I replaced it with a generic version, it's the exact same thing. I'll give you a slight discount." So he sort of confessed that he stole parts from our refrigerator, and replaced it with a cheaper version. Then I went on youtube, on how to fix the problem we had. We just had a clogged defroster, which costs $7 dollar to fix <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Original-FlexiSnake-Hair-Clog-Tool-FS1JRL/203483829">[1]</a>. Just clean the pipe with a stick. So this guy scammed us big time. If I remember correctly, they charged my uncle $700 for a $7 repair.</p>
