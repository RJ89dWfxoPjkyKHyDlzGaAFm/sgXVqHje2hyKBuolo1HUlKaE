<p>When I was a young adult, I was involved in a car accident. Here is that story.</p>

<h1>The Accident</h1>
<p>I was my uncle's passenger, my uncle was driving. The person who crashed us was a black man driver with a white woman passenger. The accident was caused because the black man was speeding through a red signal. There was a train crossing bar as proof that me and my uncle had the right-of-way.</p>

<h1>A Suspicious Detail</h1>
<p>The crazy fact is, a few months previous, my uncle was involved in a different car accident. No one crashed him. He said it was completely his own fault. His car flipped upside down, he became unconscious, and was sent to a hospital. It's so crazy that my uncle was in two car accidents within the same year. On the day of our accident, my uncle said to me "My plan is I am quitting alcohol for one year, then if I survive one year without alcohol, I will start drinking alcohol again. These past months I've been sober."</p> 

<h1>Were They On Drugs?</h1>
<p>When the accident occurred, the white woman exited her vehicle and yelled "Oh no, my baby! Oh no, my baby!" The black man said to me and my uncle "Don't worry about her. We don't have a baby. She is not pregnant. She is mentally not okay." The white woman started opening and closing different doors of her car, it seemed like she was anxiously searching for gold. My uncle said to me "Oh definitely, they were both on drugs."</p> 

<h1>The Tow Truck</h1>

<p>The tow driver was a black man, and his passenger was a latino man. The latino man immediately recognized my uncle. The latino man said to my uncle "Aye what up my homie how you been? It's been a long time." That was how the black driver trusted my uncle. The black man gave my uncle a business card and said to my uncle "Call this number, tell them your neck hurts, and you each get $3,000. So that adds up to $6,000." I was so naive that I asked "What if my neck doesn't hurt? Mine feels fine." Suddenly, the black man got very angry and scoffed at me "Do you know what is whiplash? It means you will feel the pain in one or two years from today. These people caused you an inconvenience. You are entitled to a compensation." Everyone in the tow truck instructed me to just do whatever my uncle tells me to do. My uncle said "I'll do all the talking from now on, you keep your mouth shut." So that is what I did. I let my uncle do all the talking. My uncle was older than me, I believed automatically that made him more knowledgeable.</p>

<h1>The Repair Shop</h1>
<p>The tow truck dropped me, my uncle, and our damaged car off at an auto body repair shop where all the employees were latinos. They had the paper work ready. It seemed like the employees were desparate to make me and my uncle leave out of there. The employee said "Don't worry about anything. Sign these documents. The insurance will pay for everything. You just had a traumatic experience. We understand your troubles here. An Uber is on it's way for you, free of charge." And just like that my uncle and I were out of there in less than 20 minutes. We mostly waited for the Uber driver.</p>

<h1>The Attorney</h1>
<p>At the chiropractor, we were greeted by a black man wearing a tuxedo, fedora hat, and briefcase. The black man said to us "Please give me your social security and identification cards." I gave him my social security, and I replied "I forgot my identification card at home." Suddenly, the black man scoffed at me "How old are you? You're grown man. Get your s**t together."</p> 

<h1>Chiropractor</h1>
<p>The chiropractor was a black man who instructed me to lay down on this rusty metal table with a pillow on it. The black man pressed a button, and the table started shaking. This vibrating table did nothing except make a lot of noise. This machine wasn't designed to help real injuries. The coin operated massage chairs at shopping centers are more useful than this rusty old vibrating table. It was in this very moment, I realized the chiropractor, the attorney, my uncle, everyone understood they were participating in this insurance fraud scheme. Literally, the chiropractor did not care about your health, he automatically assumed we were lying, and he went along with it. The chiropractor said "Lay down on the machine for 15 minutes. Come back a few more times. And then you get your money."</p>

<h1>My Anxiety</h1>
<p>I started panicking while reading internet articles about how auto insurance works. When I had enough information to form an argument, I then confronted my entire family. I described my theories and asked for their opinions. I was nervous and panicking. This is what I said to my family memmbers "We are dealing with organized criminals, real mafia people. These criminals have our social security numbers, they could steal our identities, and they know where we live. I can't report them to the police, I am afraid these mafia people will kill me for being a snitch. The chiropractor had no emotions in his eyes, and the attorney kept looking around at people like anyone could be an undercover cop. The tow driver receives a commission. The repair shop is scamming us with these impound fees. We should do this the legal way, and be thankful we survived unharmed."</p>

<h1>Reality Hit Me</h1>
<p>This is how my family reponded to my theories. My uncle said "Relax, don't over think things. Insurance fraud is the oldest trick in the book. And the best part is everything is untraceable. No one could tell that your spine doesn't hurt." My sister and her boyfriend both told me "We must always take advantage of this opportunity to steal from white people. White people are stealing from all of us. White people stole this country from the native americans. They never paid reparations to black people. They put japanese people in concentration camps. The prison industrial complex. Crack-Cocaine. $30,000 sounds sounds like a lot to you. Its nothing for white people. They have lamborghinis and mansions." My mother said "I have enough problems of my own."</p>

<p>My father said "You gotta play your cards right." I replied to my father "Do you remember when I was a kid, I distracted you while you were driving, you accidentally hit bumpers with the car in front of us. It was nothing, his rear bumper fell off, and that was it, his car was perfectly fine. Years later, I was a teenager, I asked you what happened, and you told me the person exaggerated the damages and so your insurance cost increased." My father replied "That's how life works when you don't play your cards right. I didn't play my cards right, my eyes should've been on the road, which I paid my dues for it. I was a loser back then. Now I am a winner."</p>

<p>I was all alone in this world realizing my family was a bunch of crooks, con artists, and fraudsters.</p>

<h1>My Neighbor's Accident</h1>
<p>My neighbor was involved in a car accident. My neighbors are a latina mother and her daughter. I had always known them to be good people with outstanding morals. They moved to this country, survived hardships, sexual abuse, and racism. Now they had two brand new cars, the latest macbooks, the latest iPhones, the daughter went to a university. I explained my own experiences about insurance fraud to them, I assumed we were all on the same opinion that insurance fraud is bad. In the middle of my story, the latina mother interrupted me and said to her daughter in spanish "You see, it's easy what I am telling you to do. Please listen to me. We must take advantage. I love you so much, my daughter I want you to have a better life. If we don't do this, they will take advantage of us because of our skin color." Suddenly, I realized we were not on the same opinion. One time the animal control appeared at my home, they had the incorrect address, within seconds my neighbor's latina mother was out here with her latest iPhone, she started video recording the animal control, she said "Are you a police? Who do you work for? Identify yourself, show me your badge numbers." So then my mother searched on google maps for local doctors in our area, and right there was a google review written by my neighbor's latina mother. She complained that her doctor was ageist and rude, when she described her health issues, they told her "You're an old woman, when you're old everything hurts. Move along, you old woman, there's people here with actual health problems unlike you. You should see a psychologist, that's really what you need." She is not even that old, but she is very obese. Is it even possible to be oppressed and obese at the same time? Also, she goes to restaurants and writes essays of bad reviews about anything, the food's temperature, slow service, overpriced, rude employees. My mother said "She recently sued her employer for worker's compensation. Every job she's had, she found a way to sue." My mother knows because she talks to her, and one time we saw her on crutches. I am not saying she is faking it, I am only saying that woman is old, and when your old everything hurts, even your leg hurts.</p>

<h1>My Aunt's Accidents</h1>
<p>My aunt parallel parked between two cars. She ran to the store. When my aunt returned, she accidentally hit bumpers with the car behind her. A black man told her "It's okay, it's probably nothing. As a precaution, we should exchange insurance details." My aunt agreed. Then, a few days or weeks later, my aunt recieved an insurance letter in the mail. That was how she realized she got scammed. The black man did it on purpose. When he saw my aunt running to the store, he parked his car extremely close to my aunt's car on purpose. The black man exagerrated the damages, and so my aunt's monthly insurance cost increased. We saw a photo of the damages he claimed. My aunt hit his bumper, but the photo showed the hood of his car was bent. It's literally impossible to hit a bumper and damage the hood like that. It looked like he damaged his own car with a baseball bat. My aunt said "He seemed like a very nice old man. I was so stupid." Then, my aunt told me "When I was an undergraduate student, I accidentally crashed someone's bumper and it fell off. It was a white husband and white wife. They said to me 'Don't worry about it. It was an honest mistake. You are a very friendly latina woman going to college. You have a whole life ahead of you,' and they let me go without asking for my insurance details."</p> 

<h1>Another Scam</h1>
<p>My grandmother's refrigerator was leaking water. The latino repair man carried the refrigerator to his shop. The repair man gave us a cheap estimate. He fixed our refrigerator, and he delivered it my grandmother's home. Then out of nowhere the latino repair man gave us a way more expensive estimate. He said "My previous estimate was the cost for the repair. I am now charging extra because I shipped and delivered the refrigerator myself." Then my uncle said "No. That is not what we agreed on." The repair man said "Well, if you don't want to pay me, I will just call the police." While they were arguing, the repair man said "There is a component in this refrigerator, I replaced it with a generic version, it's the exact same thing. I'll give you a slight discount." So he sort of confessed that he stole parts from our refrigerator, and replaced it with a cheaper version. Then I went on youtube, on how to fix the problem we had. We just had a clogged defroster, which costs $7 dollar to fix <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Original-FlexiSnake-Hair-Clog-Tool-FS1JRL/203483829">[1]</a>. Just clean the pipe with a stick. So this guy scammed us big time. If I remember correctly, they charged my uncle $700 for a $7 repair.</p>

<h1>Malpractice</h1>
<p>My mother is susceptible to scams. One time she ordered vitamin pills advertised on television, she got the pills through the mail. There was only one problem, the pills came with a one year subscription of Oprah Winfrey magazines. My mother said "I told them that I did not want magazines." My mother was diagnosed with diabetes through a health insurance company. Then for many years, my mother went to one specific latino doctor who existed beyond the financial coverage of my mother's health insurance, so my mother paid this latino doctor with cash, because my mother believed this latino doctor had some sacred knowledge of medicine. For years my mother often said "I am not allowed to eat this food because of my cholesterol." I replied "But you don't have cholesterol. You instead have diabetes." My mother replied "That's true. But my doctor said diabetes often goes along with cholesterol and high blood pressure." I rolled my eyes. My mother complained about all types of health issues, like her back and feet. Then one day out of nowhere, my relatives said that my mother might have kidney disease and might be on dialysis. I told my mother "Why didn't you tell me?" My mother said "I went to my doctor, he said something was weird about my blood results. He said there's a chance I might not survive. He gave me another test, I am still waiting on the results." I replied "And they told me you had some pills?" Slowly the story unfolded, my mother confessed "My doctor said diabetes goes along with cholesterol and high blood pressure, so he gave me all these different pills as a prevention against cholesterol, high blood pressure, and other things." My mother had piles of pill bottles that I never knew she had been taking for many years. There were different drugs, I googled the drug names, and it said those drugs have many side effects and might cause kidney failure. My mother was never diagnosed with cholesterol or high blood pressure, but this latino doctor gave her pills for that anyways, and it was ruining my mother's kidneys. I told my mother "Go to a new doctor. Don't you get it? He is a bad person. He is using you for his experimental treatments. He doesn't care about you. He is going to delete your health records, and change your results. He is afraid of being sued, he might go to prison." My mother was in denial when she said "No. I've known this doctor for many years, he has good intentions. He will cure me. It's my fault because I wasn't following his advice, I didn't change my diet. He will give me more drugs from Mexico. In Mexico, the laws are different. They prescribe heavy duty drugs that actually work. They won't sell those drugs here because there's too much bureaucracy here." I replied "It's those pills that made you like this. And now you want more pills? You were married to my father for how many years? And my father never cared about us. And do you think this stranger cares more about you? There's bad people in this world, some of them wear uniforms." My mother really hated my father. My mother replied "You're right. It's okay. I always wanted to die. I'm ready to die. I've suffered far too long." My mother stopped taking those pills. Then her frequent urination ceased. Several days later, my mother said "My back and feet feel drastically better now. Those pills were causing my symptoms." I thought my mother was going to die, she might be on dialysis. My mother went to a new doctor, and they told her she was going to be fine as long she stops taking those pills. My mother survived, she had no kidney disease or dialysis. And the craziest part is nearby that malicious latino doctor's office, there is a recently built dialysis building. I just wondered if he f**ked up everyone in that ghetto neighborhood, so now I am thinking everyone is on dialysis because of him. My mother said "I am going to sue him, because he might be doing malpractice to other people. I can save their lives." But my mother never did sue. My mother is very passive aggressive.</p>
