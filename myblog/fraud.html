<p>I was involved in a car accident, here are all the important details.</p>

<p>My uncle was driving, I was my uncles's passenger. The person who crashed us was a black man driver with his white woman passenger. The accident was caused because the black man was speeding through a red signal. There was a train crossing bar as proof that me and my uncle had the right-of-way. Me and my uncle did not suffer any injuries, most likely because my uncle and I were in a large 2012 Nissan Frontier pickup truck, the person who crashed us was in a small 1997 Nissan Corolla.</p>
