<p>I was involved in a car accident, here are all the important details.</p>

<p>My uncle was driving, I was my uncle's passenger. The person who crashed us was a black man driver with a white woman passenger. The accident was caused because the black man was speeding through a red signal. There was a train crossing bar as proof that me and my uncle had the right-of-way.</p>

<p>The crazy fact is, a few months previous, my uncle was involved in a different car accident. No one crashed him. He said it was completely his fault. His car flipped upside down, he became unconscious, and was sent to a hospital. It's so crazy that my uncle was in two car accidents within the same year. On the day of our accident, my uncle said to me "My plan is I am quitting alcohol for one year, then if I survive one year without alcohol, I will start drinking alcohol again. These past months I've been sober."</p> 

<p>When the accident occurred, the white woman exited her vehicle and yelled "Oh no, my baby! Oh no, my baby!" Then, the black man said to me and my uncle "Don't worry about her. We don't have a baby. She is not pregnant. She is mentally not okay." Then, the white woman started opening and closing the different doors of her car, it seemed like she was anxiously searching for gold. I feel like the woman was schizophrenic or on methamphetamine. If the white woman was on methamphetamine, I think it's fair to believe the black man was on methamphetamine too, and that's why he felt energetic to drive through a red light. My uncle said to me "Oh definitely, they were both on drugs."</p> 

<p>On the day of the accident, a tow truck serviced our vehicle. The tow driver was a black man, and  his passenger was a Latino man. The Latino man and my uncle immediately recognized each other from High School. The Latino man said to my uncle "Aye what up homie how you been? It's been a long time." That was how the black man trusted my uncle. The black man gave my uncle a business card and said to my uncle "Call this number, tell them your back hurts, and you each get $3,000. So that adds up to $6,000." I was so naive that I asked "What if my back doesn't hurt? Mine feels fine." Suddenly, the black man got very angry and scoffed at me "Do you know what is whiplash? It means you will feel the pain in one or two years from today. These people caused you an inconvenience. You are entitled to a compensation." Everyone in the tow truck instructed me to just do whatever my uncle tells me to do. My uncle said "I'll do all the talking from now on." So that is what I did. I let my uncle do all the talking. My uncle was older than me, I thought that automatically made him more knowledgeable.</p>

<p>The tow truck dropped me, my uncle, and our damaged car off at an auto body repair shop where all the employees were latinos. It was so creepy like everyone expected us there. They had the paper work ready. The auto body shop employees said "Don't worry about anything. Sign these documents. The insurance will pay for everything. An Uber is on it's way for you, free of charge." It seemed like they were eager for us to leave. And just like that my uncle and I were out of there in less than 20 minutes. We mostly waited for the Uber driver.</p>

<p>The next day my uncle said to me "The insurance says we need to be evaluated by a chiropractor. Bring your social security number." I simply followed my uncle's command. At the chiropractor, we were greeted by a black man wearing a tuxedo, fedora hat, and briefcase. The black man said to me "Give me your social security and state identification cards." I gave him my social security, and I replied "I forgot my identification card at home." Suddenly, the black man scoffed at me "How old are you? You're a grown man. Get your s**t together." The black man returned to his happy demeanor. It was scary, like for a brief moment he accidentally showed me his true self. His true self is evil. And his happy demeanor was a facade.</p> 

<p>Then, my uncle and I were evaluated by the chiropractor. The chiropractor was a black man with expressionless eyes. The black man instructed me and my uncle to lay down on a vibrating platform. It was a rusty table with a pillow on it. The black man instructed me to press the button. That was the moment I realized what was happening. It was an elaborate scam. This vibrating table did nothing except make a lot of noise. There was no way this machine helped anyone. It wasn't designed to fix anything. The coin operated machines at shopping centers did a better job than this rusty old vibrating table.</p>

<p>Then, when I got home I started panicking. I started reading internet articles about how auto insurance works. The next day, I had enough information to form an argument. I went around to my entire family describing my theories and asking for opinions. I was nervous and panicking. This is what I told everyone, I said this to my different family members "This is illegal. I have a bad feeling about this. These people are not your average criminals, these one are organized. I think they are stealing our identities as we speak. They have my social security number. The tow driver was supposed to deliver our damaged car to our residence. A designated insurance adjuster is supposed to evaluate the damages. This document says we are going to steal $30,000 from the insurance, the attorney takes 33%, the chiropractor takes 33%. That means we are left with only $10,000. And plus the tow driver said we are only getting $6,000. Our car is only worth $7,000. We can do this the legal way. An insurance would rather pay $7,000 than $30,000."</p>

<p>This is how my different family members responded to my theories. My uncle said "Relax, don't over think things. These people are professionals. Insurance fraud is the oldest trick in the book. And the best part is everything is untraceable. No one could tell that your spine doesn't hurt." My sister and her boyfriend both told me "You should always take advantage of every opportunity to steal from white people. White people are the ones who are stealing from all of us. White people stole this country from the native americans. They never paid reparations to black people. They put japanese people in concentration camps. The prison industrial complex." My mother said "I don't care. Leave me alone. I have enough problems of my own."</p>

<p>My father said "You gotta play your cards right." I replied to my father "Do you remember when I was a kid, I distracted you while you were driving, and you accidentally hit bumpers with the car in front of us. It was nothing, his rear bumper fell off, and that was it, his car was perfectly fine. Years later, I was a teenager, I asked you what happened, and you told me the person exaggerated the damages and so your insurance cost increased." My father replied "That's how life works when you don't play your cards right. I didn't play my cards right, my eyes should've been on the road, which I paid my dues for it. I was a loser back then. Now I am a winner. And what are you?"</p>

<p>I was all alone in this world realizing my family was a bunch of crooks, con artists, and fraudsters. I don't even know where to begin to explain the amount of f***ed up illegal things my family does.</p>
