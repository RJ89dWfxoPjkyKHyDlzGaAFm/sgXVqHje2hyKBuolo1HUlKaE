<p>I was involved in a car accident, here are all the important details.</p>

<p>My uncle was driving, I was my uncles's passenger. The person who crashed us was a black man driver with his white woman passenger. The accident was caused because the black man was speeding through a red signal. There was a train crossing bar as proof that me and my uncle had the right-of-way. Me and my uncle did not suffer any injuries, most likely because my uncle and I were in a large 2012 Nissan Frontier pickup truck, the person who crashed us was in a small 1997 Nissan Corolla.</p>

<p>The crazy fact is, a few months previous, my uncle was involved in a different car accident. No one crashed him. He said it was completely his own fault. His car flipped upside down, he became unconscious, and was sent to a hospital. On the day of our accident, my uncle said to me "My plan is I am quitting alchol for one year, then if I survive one year without alcohol, then if I survive without alcohol, I will start drinking alcohol again. These past months I've been sober."</p>

<p>When the accident occurred, the white woman exited her vehicle and yelled "Oh no, my baby! Oh no, my baby!" Then, the black man said to me and my uncle "Don't worry about her. We don't have a baby. She is not pregnant. She is mentally not okay." Then, the white woman started opening and lcosing the doors of her car, it seemed like she was anxiously searching g for gold. I feel like the woman was schizophrenic or on methamphentamine. If the white woman was on methamphetamine, I think it is fair to believe the black man was on methamphetamine too, and that's how he felt energetic to drive through a red signal. My uncle said "Oh definitely, they were both on drugs."</p>

<p>On the day of the accident, a tow truck serviced our vehicle. The tow driver was a black man, and his passenger was a latino man. The latino man and my uncle immediately recognized each other from High School. The latino man said to my uncle "Aye, what up homie how you been? It's been a long time." That was how the black man trusted my uncle. The black man gave my uncle a business card and said to my uncle "Call this number, tell them your back hurts, and you each get $3,000. So that adds up to $6,000." I was so naive that I asked "What if my back doesn't hurt? Mine feels fine." Suddenly, the black man got very angry and scoffed at me "Do you know what is whiplash? It means you will feel the pain in one or two years from today. These people caused you an inconvenienc. You are entitled to a compensation." Everyone in the tow truck instructed me to just do whatever my uncle tells me to do. My uncle "I'll do all the talking from now on. You just keep your mouth shut." So that is what I did. I didn't talk. I let my uncle do the talking. My uncle was older than me, I thought that automaticallyu made him more knowledgable.</p>
