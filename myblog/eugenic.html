<p>In order to convince you that eugenics is not racism, I am providing examples of how you are already utilizing eugenics today in your everyday life:<br>
1. Monogamy is an artificial selection.<br>
2. Celibacy is removing yourself from human gene pool.<br>
3. Wearing a condom.<br>
4. Asking for consent is the opposite of natural selection.</p>

<p>Now I am addressing the myth of eugenics ostensibly producing birth deformities due to inbreeding. Eugenics is not inbreeding, and eugenics does not cause deformities. The nose of french bulldogs are too small that it causes breathing disorders, for this reason, many airplane companies banned French Bulldogs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/07/nyregion/banned-by-many-airlines-these-bulldogs-fly-private.html">1</a>. The hips of female Boston Terrior dogs are so narrow that 92.3% of Boston Terrior births are caesarean delivered <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-5827.2009.00902.x">2</a>. 95% of Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dogs have a disorder called Syringomyelia <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2797361/">2</a>,<a href="https://vimeo.com/166015460#t=513s">3</a>. It's because humans are selfish. They did artificial selection on the dogs to produce an animal that looks cute. Dog breeders are not considering the health of their animals. All humans care about is how cute their pets appear for social media. It's possible to create healthier dogs by utilizing eugenics, however humans don't care about health, all they care about is attaining a certain type of fur, color, size, characteristic etc.</p>

<h1>My Personal Anecdote</h1>
<p>I had 5 rabbits who I raised since they were hairless newborns. In the beginning, my newborn rabbits were very friendly and docile. Several months later, when puberty happened to my young rabbits, all my female rabbits remained very friendly and docile; but all my male rabbits started violently urinating, raping, and attacking each other game of thrones style. Here is a photo I found online of a rabbit who lost his eye from fighting other rabbits 
<a href="https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/15722/do-rabbits-fight-each-other-to-the-death">1</a>. This is how visciously my male rabbits fought, but luckily never lost an eye.</p>
<p>I tried training my male rabbits, for them to stop fighting, but it was an utter failure. One time, a male rabbit latched his teeth into my arm and humped his erect penis on my hand. One time, a male rabbit attacked another male rabbit, there was blood on their lips.</p>
<p>The reason why I tried training them is because I was uninformed. I thought there was something that I was not giving them that they needed. I tried giving them the most expensive food and hay, I gave them the purest reverse osmosis water, I gave them plenty of space to roam free, I gave them my daily supervision and attention.</p> 
<p>A long time ago, when my rabbits were still drinking their mother's milk, my friend asked me "Are you going to neuter them?" I replied "No. That is barbaric and unnatural. I am just going to separate them by genders." Soon I changed my opinion.</p>
<p>After doing research online, I learned that male rabbits fight because of a chemical called testosterone. 95% of testosterone is produced by the testes. Castration significantly reduces testosterone and unwanted sexually dimorphic behaviours. Spaying reduces ovarian cancer in rabbits.</p>
<p>With this new information, I had all my rabbits spayed and neutered. The differences I noticed after their castration is my male rabbits seemed docile and civilized, they expressed zero desire to rape, the seemed less jittery and less impulsive. The castration didn't stop my male rabbits from being violent towards eachother, however, I believe this violence is a learned behavior from their fights in the past like they want revenge. My female rabbits remained the same, docile and friendly.</p>

<h1>Evidence</h1>
<p>Page 23 of "Booklet 1: Executive Summary, UNODC Global Study on Homicide 2019," says 94% of convicted killers worldwide are male. 81% of homicide victims are male.</p>
<p>When I was reading this, I remembered how my male rabbits were violent, and I remembered how my female rabbits were docile. After more research, I learned that male rabbits are not the only animals who fight. Many species all around the world, it is always the males who fight while the women remain docile. Here is a small list I created as examples: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VWFreC4onI">beatles</a>, betta fish <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0yuOSUSEs">bison</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWtwxurMJNQ">elephants</a>, equine, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_akd-o3ppAE">giraffes</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCcLMNcWZOc">kangaroos</a>, rabbits, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez7RUSCUhzk">rams</a>, roosters, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a8ncofVDuY">snakes</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHuqeIP3_HQ">zebras</a>. Click on the underlined text to watch the video examples. The male beatles fighting video is particularly interesting since it shows how male beatles fight to control all females in specific territories. Here are two famous quotes by Human White Nationalists, it is called the fourteen words, "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children," and "Because the beauty of the White Aryan woman must not perish from the earth." Basically, the fourteen words is like saying "We must secure our territory so that we may control who our women could have sex with." But then once the male beatle conquers his territory, the male beatle literally rapes and inseminates every female he encounters in his territory. When the male beatle has successfully inseminated a female beatle, the male beatle will literally throw the inseminated female beatle off a tall tree. The female beatle is left all alone and pregnant. Male beatles don't care about their offspring, all they care about is sex.</p>
<p>Let me tell you about a person in history named Genghis Khan. Genghis Khan secured the territory of the Mongol Empire. Ghengis Khan controlled all the women in his territory. During 2003 some scientists proposed a theory that Genghis Khan had sex like crazy so much that 1 in 200 people on Earth are descendants of Genghis Khan <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/367774">2</a>. During 2005 some scientists identified 11 prolific lineages <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ejhg.2014.285">3</a> including Genghis Khan, and Giocangga. Famous athlete Wilt Chamberlain claimed in his book titled "A View From Above" that he had sex with over 20,000 different women <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/08/the-sexual-prowess-of-wilt-chamberlain-20-000-women/261429/">4</a>. Fidel castro secured the territory of Cuba, there is a rumor that Fidel Castro supposedly had sex with 35,000 different women <a href="https://pagesix.com/2008/09/17/fidels-35000/">5</a>. The lesson is that humans are exactly like the male stag beatles.</p>

<h1>More Evidence</h1>

<p>Thomas Jefferson was the 3rd president of the USA, in 1808 Thomas Jefferson had two newborn grizzly bears <a href="https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/grizzly-bears">6</a>. Thomas Jefferson believed his grizzly bears could be domesticated. In the beginning, his grizzly bears were cute, tame, and adorable. Then, one day the grizzly bears went through puberty and all of a sudden the grizzly bears became violent and savage. One of Thomas Jefferson's grizzly bears attacked some humans, the humans defended themselves with a gun by killing the grizzly bear.</p>

<p>Dmitry Belyayev designed an experiment of artificial selection on wild foxes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox">7</a>. Wild foxes are crazy savage violent animals who attack humans. Dmity Belyayev's assistant was Lyudmila Trut. The experiment began in 1952 when Lyudmila Trut visited a fur farm. At the fur farm, Lyudmila Trut tested the personalities of the hundreds of foxes until finally Lyudmila Trut had selected 30 male foxes and 100 female foxes who seemed to be the least savage. The 30 male foxes mated with the 100 female foxes. There were hundreds of foxes in cages. Each month the foxes were evaluated and given an objective "tameness score." The foxes with the highest "tameness score" were allowed to reproduce, the foxes with the lowest "tameness score" were disallowed. After 40 years of doing this experiment with 45,000 foxes, the newer generation of foxes became docile and domesticated. The brains of these domesticated foxes changed genetically. The foxes were never trained by humans. The foxes remained in cages with limited human contact, which proves their behavior changed with genetics, not education. Dmitry Belyayev's experiment was validated by scientists in denmark with mink animals. Dmitry Belyayev also showed it was possible to create violent foxes by artificial selection too. This is why human eugenics is necessary. Human eugenics is going to either fix or collapse society depending on which direction it goes. Humans are exactly like Dmitry Belyayev's foxes.</p>

<p>I do not want a government mandated eugenics program. I am advocating for a feminist movement that will inspire women to stop producing offsprings with psychopaths. Women should be allowed to have sex with whoever, but choose wisely who you will produce offsprings with. If you are in an abusive relationship, leave now, the fate of the Earth depends on that.</p>
