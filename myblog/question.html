<h1>My Personal Anecdote</h1>
<p>I had 5 rabbits who I raised since they were hairless newborns. In the beginning, my newborn rabbits were very friendly and docile. Several months later, when puberty happened to my young rabbits, all my female rabbits remained very friendly and docile; but all my male rabbits started violently urinating, raping, and attacking each other game of thrones style. Here is a photo I found online of a rabbit who lost his eye from fighting other rabbits 
<a href="https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/15722/do-rabbits-fight-each-other-to-the-death">1</a>. This is how visciously my male rabbits fought, but luckily never lost an eye.</p>
<p>I tried training my male rabbits, for them to stop fighting, but it was an utter failure. One time, a male rabbit latched his teeth into my arm and humped his erect penis on my hand. One time, a male rabbit attacked another male rabbit, there was blood on their lips.</p>
<p>The reason why I tried training them is because I was uninformed. I thought there was something that I was not giving them that they needed. I tried giving them the most expensive food and hay, I gave them the purest reverse osmosis water, I gave them plenty of space to roam free, I gave them my daily supervision and attention.</p> 
<p>A long time ago, when my rabbits were still drinking their mother's milk, my friend asked me "Are you going to neuter them?" I replied "No. That is barbaric and unnatural. I am just going to separate them by genders." Soon I changed my opinion.</p>
<p>After doing research online, I learned that male rabbits fight because of a chemical called testosterone. 95% of testosterone is produced by the testes. Castration significantly reduces testosterone and unwanted sexually dimorphic behaviours. Spaying reduces ovarian cancer in rabbits.</p>
<p>With this new information, I had all my rabbits spayed and neutered. The differences I noticed after their castration is my male rabbits seemed docile and civilized, they expressed zero desire to rape, the seemed less jittery and less impulsive. The castration didn't stop my male rabbits from being violent towards eachother, however, I believe this violence is a learned behavior from their fights in the past like they want revenge. My female rabbits remained the same, docile and friendly.</p>

<h1>Other Animals</h1>
<p>Male rabbits are not the only animals who fight. Many species all around the world, it is always the males who fight while the women remain docile. Here is a small list I created as examples: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VWFreC4onI">beatles</a>, betta fish <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0yuOSUSEs">bison</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWtwxurMJNQ">elephants</a>, equine, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_akd-o3ppAE">giraffes</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCcLMNcWZOc">kangaroos</a>, rabbits, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez7RUSCUhzk">rams</a>, roosters, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a8ncofVDuY">snakes</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHuqeIP3_HQ">zebras</a>. Click on the underlined text to watch the video examples.</p>

<h1>Humans</h1>
<p class="two">Men perpetrate 95% of all murders <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_GLOBAL_HOMICIDE_BOOK_web.pdf#page=96">1</a>.</span><img src="images\2014_GLOBAL_HOMICIDE_BOOK_web.webp"></p></p>

<p class="two">81% of homicide victims are male.<img src="https://www.unodc.org/images/data-and-analysis/gsh/b1_total_homicide_share_final-01.png"></p>
<p>In other words, the entire male race is biologically hardwired to kill eachother. When a man sees another man, his instinct is to kill. That explains why men invented racism and started every war in history.</p>

<h1>Paternal Uncertainty</h1>
<p class="two">Men are hardwired to slut shame women. When humans were hunter gatherers, men hunted animals, and pregnant women picked berries. The biggest fear a man had was "What if while I am hunting animals, my wife is having sex with another man? And there is no way of knowing who is the real father." Men are afraid of being told "You are not the father." Because that would mean his whole life is a lie, he is raising someone elses child, and his genetic lineage could die off. The best way to know you are the father is by killing every man around you, only seek virgins, and slut shame women who are not virgins. For millions of years, paternity tests and pregnancy tests did not exist.</p>

<h1>Toot It & Boot It</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VWFreC4onI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VWFreC4onI</a><br>This youtube video shows men are hardwired to toot it and boot it. The phrase "toot it and boot it" is when a man has sex with a woman and then he ghosts her. Ghosting is when a man blocks all communications with someone. The vast majority of male animals on Earth are hardwired to toot it and boot it. The only exception are birds. 90% of birds are monogamous.</p>

<h1>Mating Strategy</h1>
<p>Men are hardwired to desire sex from multiple different women. Meanwhile, women are extremely selective about who she will have sex with. If a man impregnates a woman, he could always Toot It & Boot It. But if a woman is pregnant, she will be pregnant for the next 9 months. The biggest fear a woman has is being told "You are a single mother."</p>

<p class="two">When given the opportunity to have unpaid heterosexual sexual intercourse with a random person of average attractiveness, 75% of men and 0% of women would glady participate <a href="https://doi.org/10.1300/J056v02n01_04">1</a>. In other words, men will have sex with just about any random woman, but women are extremely specific about who they decide to have sex with.</p>

<h1>Conspiracy</h1>
<p class="two">Due to Mating Strategy, women are hardwired to seek wealthy men. Wealth symbolizes this man is capable of financially supporting a pregnant wife, and financially supporting his offspring. White men and Black men are fighting each other to control the world's money. If you control the money, you control women and sex. Scientists said violence begins when a man feels sexually insecure about the size of his small bank account, so low income men overcompensate by acting extra tough and masculine <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0305-750X(00)00122-4">3</a>. That explains why poor neighborhoods have more violence.</p>

<h1>The One Percent</h1>
<p class="two">The richest 1% own 44% of the world's wealth <a href="https://inequality.org/facts/global-inequality/">1</a>. And who are the 1% percent? In the USA, 85% of the richest 1% are men <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1536504220902196">2</a>. According to Global Wealth Report 2019 <a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/global-wealth-report.html">3</a>, the vast majority of the time when a woman is a billionaire it's because she inherited a wealth or business from a husband or a father. In other words, men exclusively decide which women are allowed to be billionaires, usually the male billioniare's daughters and wives.<img src="images\billion.webp"></p>

<h1>Prisons</h1>
<img src="https://static.prisonpolicy.org/images/pie2019.webp"><img src="https://static.prisonpolicy.org/images/pie_2019_women.webp"><p>Using the two pie charts above, I created the data table below. 89.8% of all convicts were male, 93.5% of violent-crime convicts were male, 93.3% of homicide-crime convicts were male.</p>

<p>No matter how you look at the data, the data tells us every cisgender straight man with a biological penis is a potential threat.<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*j37uCjodbVWmUCrmF-Xh5Q@2x.jpeg">"United States Sentencing Commission," says black women receive 29.7% SHORTER prison sentences than white men <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/demographic-differences-sentencing">1</a>.</p>
</p>

<h1>Education</h1>
<p>During 2019, 110,812 female college students participated in this survey <a href="https://www.aau.edu/key-issues/campus-climate-and-safety/aau-campus-climate-survey-2019">1</a>. 24% of verbal sexual harassment against female graduate students was perpetrated by college employees; such as a teacher, advisor, faculty, coach, trainer, etc. Depending on how rape is defined, 10.9% to 16.2% of female college students experienced a completed or an attempted rape. 73.3% of female college students said their rapist was a fellow college student.</p>

<p>How is college supposed to fix society, when the colleges themselves are perpetrating sexual harassment? According to Global Study on Homicide, 34% of murdered women were murdered by their intimate partner, and "Men who kill their intimate partners have a markedly different profile to men who kill outside relationships, according to studies from several European countries. They tend to have better jobs and enjoy a higher standard of living than other perpetrators, and often have no criminal background. One study found that men who killed their partners were better educated than other homicide perpetrators and had fewer gaps in their employment history <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/global-study-on-homicide.html">1</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1077801204265015">2</a>."</p>

<h1>White Privilege</h1>
<p>What is White Privilege worth for white women when all women are afraid of being killed and raped. Women are not allowed to leave their homes. Even in their own homes, women are not safe.</p>

<p>8,000 random women participated in a telephone survey between 1995 to 1996 <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/prevalence-incidence-and-consequences-violence-against-women">1</a>,<a href="https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles/172837.pdf">2</a>. 14.8% of women were victims of a completed rape, 2.8% of women were victims of an attempted rape. 22.1% of women were victims of a physical assault from an intimate partner. 8% of women had felt terrorized by a stalker.</p>

<p>5,758 random women participated in another telephone survey during 2015 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nisvs/summaryreports.html">1</a>,<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf">2</a>. 21.3% of women were victims of either a completed or an attempted rape. 16% of women had felt terrorized by stalkers. 37% of women were victims of an unwanted sexual contact.</p> 

<h1>Mein Kampf</h1>
<p>According to our politicians, education and income will solve all of the world's problems. But why is there sexual harrassment in college campuses? Why is there sexual harassment in the workplace? Why do rich men commit sexual crimes? The answer is simply no matter how much education and money you throw at the entire male race, all men are biologically hardwired towards greed and violence. We need a final solution to the male question.</p>

<h1>Dmitry Belyayev</h1>
<p>Dmitry Belyayev designed an experiment of artificial selection on wild foxes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox">7</a>. Wild foxes are crazy savage violent animals who attack humans. Dmity Belyayev's assistant was Lyudmila Trut. The experiment began in 1952 when Lyudmila Trut visited a fur farm. At the fur farm, Lyudmila Trut tested the personalities of the hundreds of foxes until finally Lyudmila Trut had selected 30 male foxes and 100 female foxes who seemed to be the least savage. The 30 male foxes mated with the 100 female foxes. There were hundreds of foxes in cages. Each month the foxes were evaluated and given an objective "tameness score." The foxes with the highest "tameness score" were allowed to reproduce, the foxes with the lowest "tameness score" were disallowed. After 40 years of doing this experiment with 45,000 foxes, the newer generation of foxes became docile and domesticated. The brains of these domesticated foxes changed genetically. The foxes were never trained by humans. The foxes remained in cages with limited human contact, which proves their behavior changed with genetics, not education. Dmitry Belyayev's experiment was validated by scientists in denmark with mink animals. Dmitry Belyayev also showed it is possible to create violent foxes by artificial selection too.</p>

<h1>Humans</h1>
<p>This is why human eugenics is necessary. Human eugenics is going to either fix or collapse society depending on which direction it goes. Humans are exactly like Dmitry Belyayev's foxes. I do not want a government mandated eugenics program. I believe a feminist movement will rise to inspire women to stop producing offsprings with psychopaths. Women should be allowed to have sex with whoever, but choose wisely who they will produce offsprings with. For example, if I were to have children, I would search for someone who is smarter than me, and ask them to donate their eggs/sperm.</p>

<h1>Tall Men</h1>
<p>In the 1750s, the average height of Dutch men was 5 feet 5 inches tall. But in the 1900s, the average height of Dutch men was 6 feet tall. According to scientists <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2015.0211">8</a>, Dutch women did not want to make babies with short men, they only wanted tall men. As a result, short Dutch men died off. That is the power women have on society.</p>
