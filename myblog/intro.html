<p>My name is Jovanny, I am a mexican-american. When Donald Trump said “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best," I agree with that statement, the proof I witness everyday with my own two eyes. Through out my life, there are mexicans who are trying to kill, assault, or rape me. Every traumatic event in my life was caused by a mexican. Meanwhile, through out my life there has always been whites trying to save me. The first time I ever witnessed a white human was when my sister got raped by a mexican gangster. I was just a kid, my mother took me to a very tall building. A white woman asked me "Do you have a refrigerator in your home? If I went to your home, and I opened your refrigerator, will there be food in there? Do you ever feel hungry?" Finally, the white woman asked "Do you know who is Salatiel?" As a kid, I didn't know why she asked me those questions. Then, when I got older I realized it was Social Services because Salatiel is the man who raped my sister. Then my crazy mother was in denial, she told the police "Don't listen to my daughter, she is lying, she didn't get raped." And so Salatiel never went to prison for rape, he went to prison for selling drugs. He did a couple months or years, and when he was released from prison he ran away to mexican and noone has seen or heard from him since.</p>

<p>The second white human I ever witnessed is Mr. Leonard. He visited my elementary school to teach us how to read music notes and play the plastic recorder. The most profound lesson Mr. Leanard taught us is Cymatics in the Chladni plates <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yaqUI4b974">[1]</a>.</span></p>

<p>The third white humans I ever witnessed, I don't remember if they were white, but it was in my elementary school again. A group of people arrived and gave us all vision tests, then they gave out free prescription eyeglasses. I think white people felt sorry for us because we were low income mexicans, so they would send us things for free.</p>

<p>The fourth white human I ever witnessed is the famous musician Lou Anne Neill of the Los Angeles Philharmonic <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.laphil.com/musicdb/artists/3848/lou-anne-neill">[2]</a>.</span> Lou Anne Neill taught me how to play the harp. You can watch her Youtube videos <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/U_JocTWWBW8">[3]</a>.</span>! So it's like she felt sorry for my school because we were all low income mexicans. So she went around asking rich white people for money, and that was how she was able to purchase harps for her project where she gives out FREE harp lessons to low income mexican children!</p>

<p>The fifth white human I ever witnessed is Eric Eisner. I was in elementary school, I was in the cafeteria along with a hundred students. They gave me the weirdest test I ever saw. It was no words, only patterns of shaded sqaures and triangles. A few weeks or months later, I was in the office along with 4 other students, and there was Eric Eisner, he was talking gibberish like a crazy scientist, and then he told us "I want to give each of you a scholarship." I had no idea what he was talking about. But now that I am older I realized that test I took is an IQ Test, and I think that's how Eric Eisner found out about me. Eric Eisner continued "Tell your parents to sign this paper. Have your parents bring you to my house during summer vacation where I will be giving out free lessons."</p>

<p>My mother went to the office and told them "Who is Eric Eisner? Why does this creepy man want children to visit his house?!" They replied "I understand your concern. I would ask the same questions. Eric Eisner has a good reputation with this school." Now that I am an adult I realized, my mother was scared that Eric Eisner might molest me.</p>

<p>So during that summer I went to Eric Eisner's house only once. He lived very far away in a magnificient mansion estate. There was about 20 other children there. Eric Eisner had an easel with a white dry erase board. His wife baked cookies for all of us. And Eric Eisner was just there talking to himself like a mad scientist. Eric Eisner asked "Do you have any questions about any topic?" One kid replied "I've been reading about Supernovas and Magnetars."</p>

<p>I stopped visiting Eric Eisner. I didn't see him again until years later when I was in 8th grade. Eric Eisner said "Do you remember me..." He looked down at his paper "Jovanny?" There were 2 other teenagers in the room. Eric Eiser wrote the world's simplest math problem on the white board "2+3=?" The room was silent, we all knew this must be a trick question. One arrogant teenager replied "That's easy, the answer is 5." Eric Eisner replied "But how do you know?" The teenager replied "because...uhmm like...I just know." Eric Eisner yelled "Stop it right there! You sound stupid using that word 'like.' It's annoying. No one here is allowed to use that word 'like.' When you use that word 'like' it means you do not fully understand. You must learn how to verbalize." Ever since that day I never stopped noticing how many of my peers use the word 'like.'</p>

<p>The next time I saw Eric Eisner, there was a paragraph on the whiteboard. Eric Eisner said "Our research shows your demonographic struggles with worded math problems." Then, Eric Eisner gave a speech "When I was your age, computers were the size of this very room. Now they invented a computer more powerful and small enough to fit in our pockets. Haven't you ever wondered how does a light bulb switch work?" Eric Eisner closed his eyes and tilted his head towards the ceiling, he put his fingers on his eye lids, and took a deep breath. Eric Eisner was thinking very deeply about electricity and technology, I felt like I was staring at Nikola Tesla. Eric Eisner often used expletives, and the craziest thing I ever saw him do, was when he said "Are you aware about the Aesop Fable, The Fox & the Grapes?" He explained the story and concluded "Success is hard work. But when you succeed it feels great like doing heroin!" Eric Eisner stabbed his forearm with an imaginary needle and his whole body collapsed on the sofa he was seated in. This gesture terried me, it's like he knew all about doing heroin and I was just a kid in 8th grade.</p>

<p>At the time, I was carrying a book "Heavier Than Heaven," I never got passed the first page, but Eric Eisner looked at my book cover and he said "Is that Kurt Cobain? I met him once, when I worked for Geffen Records. He was a awkward and depressed man." Eric Eisner continued "A long time ago, my friend visited Europe, and he noticed something strange about Europe, that there were no cheeseburgers there. He saw an opportunity and so he opened a restaurant, and it was called The Hard Rock Cafe." Eric Eisner looked at my clothes and he said "When we grow up, noone remembers the outfits we wore. They will certaintly remember how our words and actions made them feel. Clothes are unimportant."</p>

<p>So I never went through with Eric Eisner's scholarship. I found this really great article about Eric Eisner. I was sort of friends with Frania Navarro. Frania Navarro followed through with Eric Eisner's scholarship which got her into Brentwood School. Frania Navarro was very popular in our middle school. But when she went to Brentwood school, she became the unpoular poor latina. </p>
