<p>I wish you could say something to change my mind. I am convinced you don't care about me. Do not write anything for me. I will not read your reply. I am blocking you forever. You will know my honesty, once you are sober, and once I am gone forever as promised.</p>

<p>The following is everything that I always wanted to tell you:</p>

<p>I did not create Don Johnson Matugas. I am not the type who create fake profiles nor lurker accounts. It was never my design to harm ktj4ever9. I hope my photo tells you, I have a wicked comedy style.</p>

<p>When I found your nudes, I also found a reddit post about your boyfriend. If your boyfriend is not addicted to alcohol, you are probably in an abusive relationship. For example, "Girl on the Train" is a movie about an alcoholic woman. When she quit drinking alcohol, she realized her husband was a liar and cheater. The husband loved having an alcoholic wife because it was easier to lie, cheat, and rape her as she was intoxicated or blacked out. As soon as they broke up, he immediately found a new girlfriend. It's these psychopaths, everything they say is a lie. They use a technique called "love bombing," and "gaslighting." This is a topic that I am researching for my blog JovannyR.com. That is why I became interested in your life story Kristen, I wanted to write a story like "According to instagram this beautiful woman had a picture perfect relationship, but in real life that relationship had a dark secret." It is supposed to be an inspiring story for women. I will most likely never write that story. I am a terrible writer.</p>

<p>The Trader Joe's stalker story is a true story that ROSE told me. You can read the full story here. I wrote it becuase I just wanna fill up my blog with crazy awesome stories! I deleted it cuz it was too creepy. But I am writing this new story, I might delete it too. When I was in High School, a female peer of mine wrote her own autobiographical book! It was very good. I wanna find her on Facebook and ask her if I could post her book onto my website!!! She has never published it anywhere, she once posted it for free on Facebook! And the awesomest part is, I am a character in her autobiography!!!! She mentioned me in it!!! Hopefully she still has a copy of it. It was an Microsoft Word file. All the memes that I posted on your discord, those were meant for my website, I wanted to have a "Jovanny's Favorite Memes BLOG." But it was too stupid. That one time, I told that Dragon Ball Z is a sexual cartoon, cuz I wanted to write a blog post about it. Did you know that the very first episode of Dragon Ball Z showed a 100% fully naked cartoon penis! Real porn is illegal in China, but cartoon porn is legal there. My theory is maybe that is why their cartoons are very sexual. Kristen, since you have an OnlyFans, you would be serving a three year prison sentence if you lived in China!! So interesting! My blog post idea was supposed to be about China's culture. Did you know Hip-Hop and rap music is illegal in china!!!! So apparently in Japan, it is illegal to show photos/videos of naked genitals, Japanese people became desperate for porn so they created a new porn genre called "ahegao face" because its the only legal porn there. Click here to watch the famous OnlyFans celebrity Belle Delphine making the "ahegao face."</p>

<p>That weird stalker post I sent on discord, that was my cringey moment, but I was practicing creative writing, its cuz my favorite tv show for a time was Law and Order SVU, they played it all day on Saturaday televison. My favorite episode was when the interrogator said "You're going to prison," and the suspect said "I am already a prisoner in my own body due to my disability." That scene really impacted me because I have a disability of my own. I also liked the episode when a man said "When I was a teenager, a man raped me out there in the woods. Now I am a grown adult, but I never leave my house, I order everything online, I work from home, I go months without seeing or talking to people, because I am afraid of people. I am afraid of being hurt like that man hurt me in the woods." That scene really impacted me because when I was a teenager a man attempted to rape me, and a different man showed me his penis and told me "Go ahead and suck it faggot." Ever since that happened to me, I am afraid of people, I don't leave my house. Well I am not completely isolated, I do leave my house often, but I completely understand. So that's why I was an internet troll on twitter and I was practicing creative writing, so I can be an awesome writer for my blog. The point is I know I accidentally sent you some weird creepy messages but this is all big misunderstanding!!! Anyways, peace out dude.</p>
