<h1>The Deleted Scenes</h1>
<p class="two">Whenever Ethan Klein is caught saying racist things, he uses Youtube's Creative Studio Video Editor to trim out the specific racist minutes without deleting the entire Youtube video. But he rarely deletes things from the podcast RSS.</p>

<h1>Deleted Scene #1</h1>
<p class="two">"Old People Angry About "OK Boomer" & FaZe Jarvis - H3 Podcast #156," Ethan says blacks love fried chicken.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21550&authkey=ADZZqKZJQyxn-Do" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Deleted Scene #2</h1>

<p class="two">"#145 - We Actually Stormed Area 51," Ethan participated in a meet and greet at Rip-n-dip, and was surprised when the security guards were 6'5 black men.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21556&authkey=ACjLUWaXiib4pTc" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>Ethan hates police brutality, but when it comes to protecting his own life, he hired several security guards and told them "keep your finger on the trigger." Ethan was not joking. You can sense how uncomfortable Hila felt when she responded "I guess..."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21552&authkey=AInDik1e40QdR_w" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>Ethan apologized for the above audio clip in "Jake Paul Arrested For Looting & The Karen Invasion - H3 Podcast #193 <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/MJVM5bWcbgk?t=8986">1</a>."</span> Ethan claimed the racist clip was taken out of context. However, if you listen to the full audio, it is in context. <br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21542&authkey=AFwBFSnR14OOJG8" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Deleted Scene #3</h1>
<p class="two">"#164 - We're In YouTube Rewind," Ethan criticized kpop music. Consequently, #h3h3isoverparty was trending on twitter, and so Ethan deleted this xenophobic clip.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21548&authkey=ANUMHLJr7RDuHS4" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>Based on Ethan's quote "How did this become a thing in western culture?" it seems Ethan believes chinese men who watch kpop are infected with a gay disease, and kpop is carrying the gay pandemic over to the USA. Then Ethan made an entire 1.5 hour podcast where Ethan refused to apologize, the episode was called "#165 - K-pop Stans Cancel Us On Twitter <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFiGrdKh99s">1</a>,</span> <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/theh3podcast/status/1204816651809542144">2</a>"</span> and Youtube deleted it for xenophobia. Ethan's philosophy is that Asians need to learn how to take a joke. Asians on twitter described Ethan as "xenophobic." Then on February 12, 2021 Ethan tweeted a #StopAsianHate and called Trump supporters "xenophobic <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1364721361306836992">3</a>."</span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21551&authkey=AMwyq-RaLgLfeNI" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Deleted Scene #4</h1>
<p class="two">"#83 - Meme Royale & PewDiePie vs T-Series," Ethan Klein compared Indians to janitors. Many Indians on Youtube and Reddit were offended and so Ethan deleted this clip. <br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21546&authkey=AMlyw4ecFpO_WOU" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>"#131 - Ninja And The End Of Twitch" Ethan Klein refused to apologize. Ethan thinks Indians need to learn how to take a joke. According to India's Hindu religion, janitors are in a category called "untouchables," also known as "dalit." Dalits are the most marginalized class of people in India.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21540&authkey=AKLwiLhBebnen9Y" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21544&authkey=AIcpk8YF_4OSOpU" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Deleted Scene #5</h1>

<p class="two">On "#29 - Jacksfilms & Erik of Internet Comment Etiquette," Ethan went on a 20 minute drunken rant defending his past usage of the N word, and Ethan deleted this part.

In this example, Ethan Klein quoted Idubbbz. Idubbbz quoted a guy on kickstarter. The kickstarter guy quoted a comedian. The comedian quoted a friend group. Since they all quoted someone different, according to Ethan Klein, it was justified for them to say the N word.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21547&authkey=ACIbqbhPqZ1Vrt0" type="audio/mp3"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21545&authkey=AIvLJ2-0Ukgz2W4" type="audio/mp3"></audio></span><br>If you think about it, everyone who uses the N word is quoting someone else.</p>
