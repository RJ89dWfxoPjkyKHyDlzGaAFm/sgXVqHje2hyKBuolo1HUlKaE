Based on episode "H3 Podcast #38 - Hila Klein," Ethan Klein and Hila Klein ran away from Israel in order to evade persecution from palestinian terrorists. Ethan Klein said it is "super ignorant" to believe palestinians and iraelis could live peacefully without borders. Hila Klein replied "When I grew up, I couldn't even ride a bus, because I was too afraid of being blown up by terrorists, and the wall did help." Ethan Klein described Israel's military as "innovative." Here is video from July 2014 when Ethan Klein lived in Israel <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0rmyQfFyKw">1</a>,</span> and you can hear an explosion in the background. On June 2017 during episode #19, Ethan Klein explained his political philosophy on immigration and refugees as "When you save one life, you save the whole world <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/IHL6HazIfQ0?t=2502">2</a>."</span> In other words, Ethan Klein supports open borders in the United States, and closed borders in Israel. <br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chtbl.com/track/289382/traffic.megaphone.fm/ROOSTER6944663998.mp3?updated=1626377296#t=4415,4442" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support libopus audio files.</audio></span><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/EjkLRX7m5TY?t=4415">3</a></span><br><video controls preload="none">

</video><br>In 2019, Hila Klein expressed her belief that the United States should be strict against white supremacy exactly like Israel is strict against palestine. On May 12, 2021 Gal Gadot was canceled on twitter because she opposed palestine. On May 15, 2021 suddenly Ethan Klein tweeted his opposition of Israel <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1393699395586052098">1</a>,</span> and support for palestine. For many years Ethan and Hila opposed palestine, but when they saw celebrities who opposed palestine were being canceled on twitter, suddenly Ethan and Hila became supporters of palestine. Ethan Klein and Hila Klein frequently change their opinions to avoid being canceled.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chtbl.com/track/289382/traffic.megaphone.fm/ROOSTER9634826393.mp3?updated=1626377390#t=1191,1219" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support libopus audio files.</audio></span><br>When Hila Klein said "But there is nothing happening here," she meant the United States is doing nothing to stop white supremacy.<br>While Ethan Klein described Israel's military as "innovative" he also described the United State's military as "corruption".<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chtbl.com/track/289382/traffic.megaphone.fm/ROOSTER9361443622.mp3?updated=1626377371#t=3654.5,3676" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support libopus audio files.</audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chtbl.com/track/289382/traffic.megaphone.fm/ROOSTER9361443622.mp3?updated=1626377371#t=3105,3126" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>

Ethan said anti-semitism is debunked because Jake Paul is a greedy non-jewish person. But yet here is a video of Jake Paul's mother saying that Logan Paul and Jake Paul are in fact both Jewish.<br><video controls preload="none">

<p class="two">"No Meme Left Behind - H3 Podcast #119" Ethan criticized Kenneth Copeland because Kenneth Copeland justified owning a $60 million private jet by arguing it protects himself from demons. Months later, on an unrelated drama, Ethan Klein was criticized for owning a $10 million mansion. This huge scandal inspired Ethan Klein to create a 37 minute response video titled "Everybody Loves Ethan," where get this, Ethan Klein justified owning a $10 million mansion by arguing it protects himself from crazy white supremacists. Ethan Klein used the Holocaust to justify his $10 million mansion and his $300,000 Rolls Royce. Ethan donated $10,000 to support Black Lives Matter <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/nbHGAu9Kn_c?t=608">1</a>.</span> Literally, Ethan spends more on cars than on Black Lives Matter. I have a personal anecdote. On August 24, 2021, a burglar walked onto my property at around 3AM. I heard a noise outside. I opened my window. I asked "Who is there?" He did not reply. I said "I am right here." He looked at my face and replied "I know where you are." And he continued rummaging through my backyard things. I was terrified. He showed no remorse. I shut my window. I alarmed everyone in my household. We went outside, and the burglar was gone. I was not fortunate enough to live in a $10 million gated community, like Ethan Klein, to protect myself from criminals. Celebrities are not the only ones whose lives are in danger.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chtbl.com/track/289382/traffic.megaphone.fm/ROOSTER8805361859.mp3?updated=1626377391#t=530,564" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support libopus audio files.</audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21518&authkey=AP6WkT27TO4184k" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>





<p  class="two">On Frenemies #17, Ethan Klein described his political philosophy with his quote "I am a full blown socialist." As far back as 2017 and 2018, Ethan Klein described Scandanavia as a utopia because of their free university and free healthcare.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chtbl.com/track/289382/traffic.megaphone.fm/ROOSTER1457176303.mp3?updated=1626377321#t=5291,5400" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>

<p  class="two">There is a conspiracy theory that supposedly Ethan Klein is friends with top-level youtube employees who are giving Ethan Klein special privileges. Ethan Klein said these allegations are unfounded and inherently antisemitic. However, here is an audio clip of Ethan Klein casually bragging about how he is able to text the Vice President of Youtube whenever he feels like it.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chtbl.com/track/289382/traffic.megaphone.fm/ROOSTER3588181250.mp3?updated=1626377380#t=2853,2861" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support libopus audio files.</audio><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chtbl.com/track/289382/traffic.megaphone.fm/ROOSTER2045401046.mp3?updated=1626377274#t=1666,1674" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support libopus audio files.</audio></span><br>Susan Wojcicki is the CEO of Youtube.</p>


<p class="two">Whenever Ethan Klein is caught saying racist things, Ethan uses Youtube's Creative Studio Video Editor "Trim <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/4hGe9KmRr4s">1</a>"</span> feature to trim out the specific racist minutes without deleting the entire Youtube video. But he doesn't delete things from the podcast RSS.</p>

<h1>Deleted Video #1</h1>
<p class="two">"#4 - iDubbbzTV," Ethan Klein said the N word. Interestingly, Ethan did not delete the video of himself saying the N word. However, in "#29 - Jacksfilms & Erik of Internet Comment Etiquette," Ethan went on a 20 minute drunken rant defending his usage of the N word, and Ethan did delete this. The timestamp is 03:18:49. to 03:39:00. <br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/audio_only_idubbbz.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=309,324" type="audio/mp3">Your browser does not support libopus audio files.</audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/audio_only_idubbbz.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=455,471" type="audio/mp3">Your browser does not support libopus audio files.</audio></span><br><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21513&authkey=AOn8JAXHaGnZEqU" type="audio/mp3">Your browser does not support libopus audio files.</audio></p>

<p class="two">"#145 - We Actually Stormed Area 51," Ethan participated in a meet and greet at Rip-n-dip, and was surprised when the security guards were 6'5 black men.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/H3_Podcast_145_-_Area_51_AUDIO.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=1227,1275" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support libopus audio files.</audio></span><br>Ethan apologized for the above audio clip in "Jake Paul Arrested For Looting & The Karen Invasion - H3 Podcast #193 <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/MJVM5bWcbgk?t=8986">1</a>."</span> Ethan claimed the racist clip was taken out of context. However, if you listen to the full audio, it is in context.</p>

<p class="two">"Old People Angry About "OK Boomer" & FaZe Jarvis - H3 Podcast #156," Ethan theorized that blacks love fried chicken. <br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/H3_Podcast_156_AUDIO.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=4734,5032" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>

<h1>Deleted Video #4</h1>
<p class="two">"#164 - We're In YouTube Rewind," Ethan criticized the BTS boyband. Consequently, #h3h3isoverparty was trending on twitter, and so Ethan deleted this xenophobic clip. Then Ethan made an entire 1.5 hour podcast where Ethan refused to apologize, the episode was called "#165 - K-pop Stans Cancel Us On Twitter <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFiGrdKh99s">1</a>,</span> <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/theh3podcast/status/1204816651809542144">2</a>"</span> and Youtube deleted it for xenophobia. Ethan's philosophy seems to be that he thinks Asians need to grow up and learn how to take a joke. Asians on twitter described Ethan as "xenophobic." Then on February 12, 2021 Ethan tweeted a #StopAsianHate and reffered to Trump supporters as "xenophobic and racist <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1364721361306836992">3</a>."</span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/h3_podcast_164_reexport_AUDIO.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=1544,1566" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support libopus audio files.</audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chtbl.com/track/289382/traffic.megaphone.fm/ROOSTER1889742275.mp3?updated=1626377375#t=251,293" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>

<h1>Deleted Video #5</h1>
<p class="two">"#83 - Meme Royale & PewDiePie vs T-Series," Ethan Klein compared Indians to janitors. Many Indians on Youtube and Reddit were offended and so Ethan deleted this clip. Ethan Klein refused to apologize. Ethan's philosophy seems to be that he thinks Indians need to grow up and learn how to take a joke. According to India's Hindu religion, janitors are in a category called "untouchables," also known as "dalit." Dalits are the lowest and most marginalized class of people in India.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/H3_Podcast_-_TotW_Meme_Royale_and_PewDiePie_vs_T-Series_-_04_September_2018_-_03-00-17_PM.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=4132,4142" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support libopus audio files.</audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chtbl.com/track/289382/traffic.megaphone.fm/ROOSTER8883999566.mp3?updated=1626377390#t=5280,5401" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>

<p class="two">Ethan and Hila own two purebred maltese. Also, Ethan's mother owns one purebred maltese. Also, Ethan's friend owns a purebred Maltese. Ethan's first maltese Shredder was purchased from a professional dog breeder. Ethan received so much criticism, that Ethan Klein was peer pressured into rescuing his second maltese Alfredo from an animal shelter. This shows Ethan does not care about doing the right thing, all he cares about is his public image. Ethan Klein hates racism, but he only loves purebreed animals. He thinks purbreed animals are superior than mutts.<br><br>Let me explain why it's so f*cked up how Ethan "rescued" a purebred puppy. Basically, in animal shelters, people only want to adopt purebred puppies, and they ignore ugly old dogs. And that is why ugly old dogs are the most euthanized. "No-Kill shelters" is a huge lie. In reality, No-Kill shelters look at your dog, and if your dog is old and ugly, they will say to your face "I am sorry, our facility is full at this moment." And so literally people tie their dogs up outside of No-Kill shelters and abandon them there. Some just leave their pet on the side of a freeway.<span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21514&authkey=ANIZPTI06cksJN0" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>

<p>I have a few more examples of Ethan being a hipocrit. I am currently investigating whether it is worth writing about.</p>
