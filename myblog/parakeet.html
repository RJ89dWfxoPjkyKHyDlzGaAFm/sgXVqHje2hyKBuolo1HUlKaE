<p>On November 18, 2021 my female parakeet died prematurely. I could have prevented it. Here is how you could prevent yours from dying. I believe my bird died from Pasty Butt syndrome. One day I looked at my parakeet's butt, and there was a huge lump of poop on her butt. I tried to remove it, but it was stuck on there like cement. And I failed to remove it. So the next day, she died. I did research online, and that's when I realized my parakeet died from Pasty Butt syndrome. So please if you have a bird or chicken. Always check her butt hole. Sticky poop hardens like cement on their butt and it prevents them from pooping. So they die of constipation.</p>

<p>About one month before my parakeet died, I saw there was poop stuck on her butt. Twice I cleaned it off. Several days later, I saw her butt hole was bald. My theory is she was plucking her feathers out trying to clean her butt hole. I did not know she could die from poop stuck on her butt. So I stopped paying attention to her butt. She started acting very weird. She stopped flying. She would only walk and sleep on the ground. And when she was on the ground, I was unable to see her butt hole. But she seemed so happy and relaxed. It turns out she was dying. But she was not screaming nor crying. That's why I did not believe she was dying. I know my bird had an underlying issue which caused her to have sticky poops. But I also know she would still be alive today if I had known to clean her butt. A guy on youtube says if you wet the poop, it's easier to remove it. Please don't let my bird die in vain. If you know someone with a bird, tell them about Pasty Butt syndrome.</p>
