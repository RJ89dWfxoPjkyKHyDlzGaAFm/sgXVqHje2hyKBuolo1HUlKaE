<p>On November 18, 2021 my female parakeet died prematurely. I could have prevented it. Here is how you could prevent yours from dying. I believe my bird died from Pasty Butt syndrome. One day I looked at my parakeet's butt, and there was a huge lump of poop on her butt. I tried to remove it, but it was stuck on there like cement. And I failed to remove it. So the next day, she died. I did research online, and that's when I realized my parakeet died from Pasty Butt syndrome. So please if you have a bird or chicken. Always check her butt hole. Sticky poop hardens like cement on their butt and it prevents them from pooping. So they die of constipation.</p>

<p>About 30 days before my parakeet died, I saw there was poop stuck on her butt. Twice I cleaned it off. Several days later, I saw her butt hole had a miniscule bald spot. When she died, the bald spot was significant. My theory is she was plucking her feathers out trying to clean her butt hole. I did not know she could die from poop stuck on her butt. So I had stopped paying attention to her butt. She started acting very weird. She stopped flying. She would only walk and sleep on the ground. And when she was on the ground, I was unable to see her butt. But she seemed so happy and relaxed. It turns out she was dying. But she was not screaming nor crying. That's why I did not believe she was dying. I know my bird probably had an underlying issue which caused her to have sticky poops. But I also know she would still be alive today if I had known to clean her butt. A guy on youtube says if you wet the poop, it's easier to remove it. Please don't let my bird die in vain. If you know someone with a bird, tell them about Pasty Butt syndrome.</p>

<p>This is the only photo I have of her, captured on January 8, 2019. She was my friend for 6 years. Around that time, I wrote this poem about her. Here it goes.</p>

<p>"This is my Liddo Birdish. Every morning she wakes up very early to fly out of her mansion (cage). She perches herself in front of our window and chirps, chirps, chirps. She is very smart. She has Tetrachromacy which means she can see 100 million colors in the world! That's 100 times more colors than you. She chirps about 1 hour every day. Her ardous singing voice has attracted many sparrow birds outside our window. They arrive here to serenade her as well. I always feel sorry to those birds who are homeless in comparison to my Liddo Birdish. My Liddo Birdish is a Liddo Princess compared to they. My Liddo Birdish lives in a beautiful palace called my house, she sleeps in a warm cage I cover with blankets, she gets her food in a bowl and water fortifed with vitamins and minerals. Those homeless sparrows drink water from the sides of roads. I wonder where they eat, and where they sleep at night when it's cold."</p>

<p>During our first 4 years together, I made so many sacrifices for you. I am sorry I neglected you during your final 2 years. I love you so much. I hope you are in heaven as my guardian angel. From now on, I will cherish every moment I have with my rabbits. When you're in heaven, I hope you are wise enough to understand why I accidentally neglected you. I neglected you because I was disabled, and my disability caused me to fall into a very deep depression. I was full of anger, hatred, and paranoia. You were always my friend.</p>

<p>On the day you died. I saw you standing on the ground. I layed my body down next to you. I rubbed my forehead onto to your cheek, and I sang a song to you. It lasted for only 90 seconds. You looked very sleepy. I didn't know you were dying. I hope those 90 seconds of me singing to you was enough to remind you that I love you.</p>

<h1>Learn From My Mistakes</h1>
<p>In my opinion, the most likely cause of my bird dying was her seed only diet. I tried various methods. I tried wet/dry/pulverized/crushed/mashed pellets. Nothing worked. Here is the closest I ever got. Please try this option. Get your hands on some "Hulled Millet." Hulled means the outer shell is removed. When a seed has a shell on it, your bird knows it's a seed, and she knows it's food. By giving her hulled millet, your bird will learn that some food has no shell. It took a while, but eventually my bird started eating the hulled millet. So then I tried adding wet/dry/pulverized/crushed/mashed pellets mash into the hulled millet. My bird entirely ignored those bowls. So then I tried the regular dry pellets, and my bird atleast acknowledged and ate from that bowl, she ate the hulled millet, but she completely ignored the pellets. I gave up, and I just accepted my bird will never eat pellets. But I wish I had tried harder. I gave up too soon because I had lost all my willpower from trying the various failed mashed pellet methods. Victory was just around the corner. But I gave up too soon. The regular seed mix has oat groats, red millet, canary grass seed, pellets, and flaxseed. When I gave up, I told myself "I am sure this store brought seed mix was designed by scientists, and if a scientist designed this seed mix, then I guess it's perfectly fine to feed my bird only seeds. And plus this seed mix has pellets already in them, maybe eventually my bird will eat some pellets." I was wrong. My bird lived her whole life eating only seeds. There were pellets in her seed mix, but she always ignored the pellets. I wish I could go back in time, and only feed my bird hulled millet mixed with pellets, eventually it will have worked. Also, I gave up because the pellets I had was slightly larger than the hulled millet. My bird ignored the pellets due to the size difference. You should try to find a pellet roughly the same size and hardness as a regular piece of millet. I love you so much, my bird, I am sorry I gave up too soon.</p>
