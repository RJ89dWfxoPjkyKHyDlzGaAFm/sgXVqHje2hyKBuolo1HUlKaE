<p class="two">According to Global Wealth Report <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/global-wealth-report.html">1</a>,</span> all the world's wealth in 2019 added up to a grand total of 399.179 trillion in U.S. dollars. In 2019 there were 7.674 billion humans. If we evenly distribute all of the world's wealth, then each human would have a net worth of $52,017. If your net worth is worth more than $52,017 then you are contributing to wealth inequality. If your net worth is $52,017 then you are oppressing noone. If your net worth is $52,017 times 3, then you are oppressing 2 humans. And so on. For example, the world's wealthiest is Jeff Bezos who has a net worth of $187.5 billion. Jeff Bezos is oppressing 3,604,585 humans. Trevor Noah's net worth is $100 million, so Trevor Noah is oppressing 1,922 humans. 1,922 humans are struggling to pay rent and nearly starving to death because of Trevor Noah's greed. The oppressors are billionaires, millionaires, AND hundred-thousandaires. 12.4% of adults have a net worth greater than $100,000. >$1,000,000 are the one percent.<img src="global-wealth-report-2020-en.webp" max-width="100%" max-height="100%"></p>

<p class="two">In 1996, China passed a law that today prevents average chinese civilians from owning guns. The only type of guns chinese civilians are allowed to own are hunting rifles, a hunting permit is required. China's gun laws are viewed as a success. USA has a firearms homicide rate of 4.63 per 100,000 inhabitants. China has a firearms homicide rate of 0.04 per 100,000 inhabitants. American civilians own 120.5 guns per 100 civilians. Chinese civilians own 3.6 guns per 100 civilians.<br><img src="homicide-rates-from-firearms.webp"></p>

<p class="two">It is interesting how China is against it's own citizens owning guns, and yet China gave guns to Islamic terrorists. 43.5% of Islamic terrorists got their military weapons from China. Every mass produced military weapon comes with a factory engraving which tells us where that weapon was manufactured <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/story/terror-industrial-complex-isis-munitions-supply-chain/">1</a>.</span>. In 2004, the USA realized China sold missiles to Islamic terrorists, and the USA reacted by passing a law that today prevents americans from purchasing made-in-china weapons (norinco). Why would China sell weapons to terrorists? Historians call it Proxy Warfare.<br><img src="https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/12330.jpeg">Historians call it Proxy Warfare. China and the USA have always been at war, with poor countries being used as pawns/proxies. If a poor country is turning into a communist governemt, the USA provides military and financial aid to force the poor country into a capitalist government. One example of Proxy Warfare is the Nicaraguan Revoluton. Nicaragua was turning into a communist government, so the USA provided financial and military aid to the capitalist Contras, and China provided financial and military aid to the communist Sandinista. Another example of Proxy Warfare is the Vietnam War, China gave weapons to the communist North Vietnam.<br><img src="vietnam.webp"></p>

<p class="two">This woman named Rokhshana was stoned to death. The crime she committed is called (zina) adultery. A wealthy man can say "You are my wife now. Our wedding is in two weeks. I am sending $100,000 to your father." If the bride replies "No," they kidnap her. If the bride runs away, it is assumed she ran away to have sex with a different man, which means she commits adultery. According to "Sahih Muslim, Book 17, Hadith 4194" the proper punishment for zina is death by stoning.

</video><br>Bride Kidnapping is when a man shows up at a woman's house, climbs in her window, kidnaps her, holds her hostage, and rapes her. Because the woman got raped, that means she technically had sex before marriage. Having sex before marriage means she is a slut bringing dishonor to her family's reputation. Her entire family and village excommunicates her. Employers refuse to hire sluts, so she becomes homeless, and could be stoned to death called Honor Killing. To preserve her family's reputation, she is expected to marry her rapist. If she marries her rapist that means she is no longer a slut. According to almost every religion, women being sluts is one of the worst crimes. Because a long time ago, a slut named Eve sexually seduced a perfect human named Adam, and because of Eve everyone on Earth is suffering. Every time a woman is a slut, she is practicing satanism. Bride Kidnapping was so common and normal that it is now a tradition called Ala Kachuu in Kyrgyzstan where consenual Bride Kidnappings are staged in front of a whole village. Women see it as romantic, men see it as a right of passage.</p>

</video>Most muslim women do not feel oppressed. Most muslim women believe Allah is our ultimate creator. Allah knows what's best for women. If the Quran says women need less rights, muslim women won't ask questions, they simply follow Allah's rules, and call it "faith." Non-muslims go to Araf which is neither hell nor heaven. Araf is a place of nothingness. Once you convert to Islam, you are officially subjected to heaven and hell. Sidra believes homosexuality is the path to hell. "I didn't make the rules guys." Allah made the rules. Sidra says gay muslims should make an honest effort to stop thinking homosexual thoughts <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/TlsZCJfEHN8?t=28">1</a></span>, stop practicing homosexual behaviors, and stop demonstrating gay pride <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYprL7ae2cQ">2</a></span>. Straight muslims make sacrifices for Allah, and Sidra expects gay muslims to make sacrifices too. One sacrifice Sidra made is she does not listen to music. Sidra says it is wrong to remind a homosexual that he is treading on the path to hell <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ninja.mommy/video/6870531396004269313">3</a></span>, because then that would make homosexuals leave the muslim religion. Instead, you have to teach homosexuals how to repent. According to Quran 16:106, leaving the muslim religion is called apostasy, and apostasy is the surest way to hell. So it better to be a sinner than an apostate. Allah has no mercy for apostates. But if you're a sinner, there is a chance Allah will have mercy. Apostasy gives you the death penalty in Afghanistan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://humanists.international/get-involved/resources/the-right-to-apostasy-in-the-world/">4</a></span>.

<p class="two">According to the Quran, sex-before-marriage, oral sex, anal sex, masturbation, and pornography are forbidden. According to Quran 3:4, muslim men are allowed to practice polygamy with a maximum of 4 wives at once. Muslim women are only allowed to practice monogamy. If a muslim man cannot find a suitable wife, the Quran permits men to have an unlimited number of "right hand possessions (Ma Malakat Aymanukum)." Considering it's historical context, the consensus among muslims scholars is that the "right hand possession" is a euphemism for a female sex slave. Therefore, the Quran permits sexual slavery. Quran 33:50 says female prisoners of war may be used as sex slaves. Therefore, ISIS cannot use their own muslim women as sex slaves, only prisoners of war may be used as sex slaves. In 2014, ISIS declared a "holy war" against Yazidi people. The United Nations estimates ISIS killed 5,000 thousand Yazidi men, and forced 7,000 Yazidi women into sexual slavery.</p>

<p class="two"><img src="https://istizada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/types-of-islamic-veils-1024x572.jpg"><br>Quran 24:31 says all women must dress modestly by wearing a hijab. In 2005, Iran created a specialized police department called "moral police," whose only purpose is to arrest women who refuse to wear the hijab. The most famous example is a woman named Saba Kord Afshari who was arrested in February 2018 and is currently still serving a 9 year prison sentence because she twice refused to wear a hijab. Saba Kord Afshari is guilty of a crime called "inciting prostitution." In other words, "asking for it." Basically, the female body distracts men's religious servitude. Similarly, in the United States some schools banned leggings and short skirts because those garments distract men's education.<br><video controls preload="none">
