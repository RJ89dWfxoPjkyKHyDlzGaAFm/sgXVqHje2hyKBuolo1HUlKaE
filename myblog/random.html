<p class="two">In 2019, the african-american scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson shared his own unique black perspective on twitter <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/1158074774297468928">1</a>.</span> Neil Tyson argued that we should worry more about viral pandemics than mass shootings, so Ethan Klein went on a 20 minute rant where Ethan told Neil "Shut the fuck up <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1100">2</a>,</span> you fucking imbecile <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1272">3</a>,</span> you fuckin idiot <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1845">4</a>,</span> motherfucker <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=2044">4</a>!"</span> I edited this stonetoss photo to depict why Ethan is racist <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="ethan.webp">3</a>.</span> Ethan reffered to Neil as "Smoke the Grass Tyson <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1384">4</a>,"</span> white supremacists commonly depict blacks as drug addicts. Then Ethan made a racist impression of a black jamaican smoking marijuana. Ethan said "smoke deGrasse mon." "Mon" is a common phrase in jamaica. In 2019, marijuana was illegal in Jamaica, so literally Ethan described Jamaicans as criminals. Hila said "Yours truly <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=2044">4</a>,"</span> a reference to OJ Simpson's twitter bio, putting Neil Tyson in the same category as OJ Simpson. In a previous podcast, Ethan described OJ Simpson as "a known murderer <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/m5_ye2jGKdk?t=3950">4</a>,"</span> Ethan & Hilas employee named Daniel Swerdlove described Neil Tyson as "This shit makes me miss Carl Sagan <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=2085">4</a>,"</span> "Shit" is a reference to Neil's skin color. That is so racist like they are saying that Neil Tyson is unoriginal and an imitation of a white scientist. And the craziest part is Neil Tyson's rhetoric was correct all along because a few months later the coronavirus pandemic began.</p>
<h1>Ethan is Racist</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan condemned the "white supremacists" who refused to accept the verdict of Derek Chauvin's trial <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/bfKPts4BJkA?t=1976">1</a>.</span> Ironically, Ethan himself refused to accept the verdict of OJ Simpson's trial, Ethan said "We have to remember that this guy is a literal murderer, he visciously killed two people with a knife, and cut their heads off. <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/UA34AS9XtbU?t=4541">8</a>"</span> Ethan continued "Do we all agree that OJ Simpson is guilty? I love how everyone points to the justice system as the end all be all. <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/q73TtQLC-W4?t=5821">9</a></span>" Dan replied "It's a fundamental misunderstanding. When you are acquitted, it doesn't mean you are innocent. That's why they call it not guilty." Ethan said this about Michael Jackson "I'm a critic of Michael Jackson, I think he is a filthy pedo <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/rwhVqYVZHqI?t=2526">1</a>."</span> Ethan described R Kelly as "That dude is a creep, I mean listen guys, it's public knowledge that he was boning Aaliyah when she was like 14 or 15 <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/B29sPyBo3_I?t=4676">1</a>."</span> And Ethan accused Patrice Wilson of being a pedo. So there you have it, Ethan Klein accused four (legally) innocent black men. False accusations against innocent blacks is the exact definition of racism. According to the Presumption of Innocence law, everyone is innocent until proven guilty. According to the Double Jeopardy law, once you are acquitted of a crime, you are innocent forever. Ethan Klein is racist, but he pretends to be an ally. If you're not convinced that Ethan and Hila are racist, listen to this audio clip of them discussing purbred animals. They believe certain races of animals are superior.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="purebred.webm" type="audio/ogg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>

<h1>Deleted Audio Intro</h1>

<p class="two">Whenever Ethan is caught saying racist things, Ethan uses Youtube's Creative Studio Video Editor "Trim <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/4hGe9KmRr4s">1</a>"</span> feature to trim out the specific racist minutes without deleting the entire Youtube video. But he didn't delete it from his podcast RSS because he is using a third party service provider called LibSyn.com and blubrry.com. The entire thesis of episode "Erased David Dobrik Footage Proves Trisha Was Right All Along - Frenemies #21" was Ethan criticising people who delete evidence. Ethan and Hila wondered why does David Dobrik keep deleting evidence, and Ethan said "I think David just has too much to lose and he's super scared. But ultimately you have to do the right thing. Him ignoring this is going to make this worse and worse." Ethan is a hipocrite.</p>

<h1>Deleted Audio #1</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan said the N word during the episode "#4 iDubbbzTV." Timestamp at 3 minutes, also at 7 minutes.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="racist.webm" type="audio/ogg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>

<h1>Deleted Audio #2</h1>
<p class="two">In the episode "#29 - Jacksfilms & Erik of Internet Comment Etiquette," Ethan went on a 20 minute drunken rant defending his usage of the N word. The timestamp is 03:18:49. to 03:39:00. Ethan argued that his N word usage was taken out of context. That is a blatant lie. If you listen to the full audio, Ethan used the N word to challenge political correctness and promote freedom of speech. And the stupidest part is, during the Deleted Audio #1, Ethan argued that if we are only quoting the N word from someone else, then it should not count as racism. Ethan was quoting Ian Walker, and Ian Walker was quoting some guy on Youtube, and the guy on Youtube was quoting a comedian, and that comedian was probably quoting a different person. By Ethan's logic that means the N word isn't racist because we are all just quoting a different person!<br><audio controls preload="none"><source src="deleted.webm" type="audio/ogg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></p> 

<h1>Deleted Audio #3</h1>

<p class="two"> So here is an audio recording of Ethan being racist during the episode "We Actually Went To Area 51 - H3 Podcast #145." Timestamp begins at 20 minutes. Ethan hates police brutality, and here Ethan encouraged his security guards to be trigger happy. And of course Ethan thinks blacks are scary.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="security.webm" type="audio/ogg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span><br>Ethan apologized for the above audio clip in this episode "Jake Paul Arrested For Looting & The Karen Invasion - H3 Podcast #193" <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/MJVM5bWcbgk?t=8986">1</a>.</span> Timestamp begins at 02:29:43. Ethan said that video was taken out of context. Ethan straight up lied to all of us. If you listen to the full audio, Ethan hired body guards for a meet and greet and was surprised when the body guards were black. The fact Ethan deleted evidence from Youtube is an admission of guilt. </p>
<h1>Deleted Audio #4</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan made a racist observation during the episode "Old People Angry About "OK Boomer" & FaZe Jarvis - H3 Podcast #156". Timestamp begins at 01:18:53. Ethan noticed that blacks love fried chicken.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="popeyes.webm" type="audio/ogg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>

<h1>Patrice Wilson</h1>
<p class="two">Patrice Wilson founded the company "ARK Music Factory" where parents paid Patrice to film music videos for the parents' children. It's just a bussiness model, the parents paid Patrice, and the children feel like they are living the pop star lifestyle. The most famous song that Ark Music Factory created is Rebecca Black's "Friday" song. Ethan made a video titled "Alison Gold - ABCDEFG -- h3h3 reaction video" where Ethan allegedly told jokes about Patrice Wilson, except noone was laughing, but everyone was thoroughly creeped out. But here is why Ethan is racist. Ethan reacted to MattyBRaps, which is literally a youtube channel with a bunch of white children dancing. And Ethan did not describe that channel as creepy. Ethan chose a music video with a blonde girl, and automatically Ethan accused Patrice of trying to rape the blonde girl. White supremacists commonly depict blacks as rapists of specifically blonde girls, it's a racist trope. And then Ethan simulated a false police report against Patrice. The joke was that Ethan doesn't feel safe around Patrice because Patrice is a creepy black man, so he needs the police to protect him from black people. Ethan never said anything bad about the blonde girl in the music video, Ethan portrayed her as the innocent victim. But suddenly there was a black girl in the music video and Ethan said "I don't know why they cast a young hermaphrodite for the role <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/4N6iM3qbYMM?t=388">1</a>."</span> Ethan was being racist and homophobic at the same time. Ethan called Patrice a pedo, and it made Patrice lose his jobs, house, and car. To this day Ethan shows no remorse, Ethan continues to call Patrice a pedo. Ethan's supporters say that Patrice did it to himself, it's Patrice's fault. Listen to Patrice's audio below <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/QYVP-mMVRVg?t=379">1</a>,</span> and decide for yourself who is wrong here. Mister Rogers had an entire television show featuring children, but noone ever accuses Mister Rogers of being a pedo because Mister Rogers has white privilege.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="patrice.webm" type="audio/ogg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>
