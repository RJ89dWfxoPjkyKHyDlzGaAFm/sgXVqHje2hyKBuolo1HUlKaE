<h1>Deleted Audio Intro</h1>

<p class="two">Whenever Ethan Klein is caught saying racist things, Ethan uses Youtube's Creative Studio Video Editor "Trim <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/4hGe9KmRr4s">1</a>"</span> feature to trim out the specific racist minutes without deleting the entire Youtube video. But he doesn't delete things from the podcast RSS.</p>

<h1>Deleted Audio #1</h1>
<p class="two">"#4 - iDubbbzTV," Ethan Klein said the N word. Interestingly, Ethan did not delete the video of himself saying the N word. However, in "#29 - Jacksfilms & Erik of Internet Comment Etiquette," Ethan went on a 20 minute drunken rant defending his usage of the N word, and Ethan did delete this. The timestamp is 03:18:49. to 03:39:00. <br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/audio_only_idubbbz.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=309,324" type="audio/mp3">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/audio_only_idubbbz.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=455,471" type="audio/mp3">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span><br><audio controls preload="none"><source src="deleted.webm" type="audio/mp3">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></p>


<h1>Deleted Audio #2</h1>

<p class="two">"#145 - We Actually Stormed Area 51," Ethan participated in a meet and greet at Rip-n-dip, and was surprised when the security guards were 6'5 black men.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/H3_Podcast_145_-_Area_51_AUDIO.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=1227,1275" type="audio/mpeg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span><br>Ethan apologized for the above audio clip in "Jake Paul Arrested For Looting & The Karen Invasion - H3 Podcast #193 <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/MJVM5bWcbgk?t=8986">1</a>."</span> Ethan claimed the racist clip was taken out of context. However, if you listen to the full audio, it is in context.</p>
<h1>Deleted Audio #3</h1>
<p class="two">"Old People Angry About "OK Boomer" & FaZe Jarvis - H3 Podcast #156," Ethan theorized that blacks love fried chicken. <br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/H3_Podcast_156_AUDIO.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=4734,5032" type="audio/mpeg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>

<h1>Deleted Audio #4</h1>
<p class="two">"#164 - We're In YouTube Rewind," Ethan criticized the BTS boyband. #h3h3isoverparty was trending on twitter, and so Ethan deleted this xenophobic clip. Then Ethan made an entire 1.5 hour podcast where Ethan refused to apologize, the episode was called "#165 - K-pop Stans Cancel Us On Twitter <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/theh3podcast/status/1204816651809542144">1</a>"</span> and Youtube deleted it for xenophobia.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/h3_podcast_164_reexport_AUDIO.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=1544,1566" type="audio/mpeg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>

<p class="two">"#83 - Meme Royale & PewDiePie vs T-Series," Ethan described Indians like janitors, many Indians on Youtube and Reddit were offended and so Ethan deleted this clip.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/H3_Podcast_-_TotW_Meme_Royale_and_PewDiePie_vs_T-Series_-_04_September_2018_-_03-00-17_PM.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=4132,4142" type="audio/mpeg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>

<p class="two">According to Global Wealth Report <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/global-wealth-report.html">1</a>,</span> all the world's wealth in 2019 added up to a grand total of 399.179 trillion in U.S. dollars. In 2019 there were 7.674 billion humans. If we evenly distribute all of the world's wealth, then each human would have a net worth of $52,017. If your net worth is worth more than $52,017 then you are contributing to wealth inequality. If your net worth is $52,017 then you are oppressing noone. If your net worth is $52,017 times 3, then you are oppressing 2 humans. And so on. For example, the world's wealthiest is Jeff Bezos who has a net worth of $187.5 billion. Jeff Bezos is oppressing 3,604,585 humans. Trevor Noah's net worth is $100 million, so Trevor Noah is oppressing 1,922 humans. 1,922 humans are struggling to pay rent and nearly starving to death because of Trevor Noah's greed. The oppressors are billionaires, millionaires, AND hundred-thousandaires. 12.4% of adults have a net worth greater than $100,000. <img src="global-wealth-report-2020-en.webp" max-width="100%" max-height="100%"></p>

<h1>Twitter and Reddit</h1>
<p class="two">According to Apple <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#1.1.4">1</a></span> and Google <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9878810/inappropriate-content">2</a>,</span> porn is not allowed on their app stores. That is why you cannot find PornHub and OnlyFans in the official Android and iPhone app stores. According to Twitter <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/media-policy">3</a></span> and Reddit <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#1.1.4">4</a>,</span> porn is allowed on Twitter and Reddit. That means Twitter and Reddit are openly pornographic apps. Legally speaking, Twitter and Reddit should be banned from Android and iPhone.<br><br>On November 16 2018, Apple banned Tumblr because of underaged porn <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104366/tumblr-ios-app-child-pornography-removed-from-app-store">5</a></span>. In order to remain on the Apple App Store, on December 3 2018 Tumblr outright banned ALL Tumblr porn <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123752/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-date-explicit-changes-why-safe-mode">6</a>.</span> On December 4 2020 New York Times exposed the millions of underaged porn on Reddit, Twitter, Google, and Pornhub <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html">7</a>.</span> As a direct consequence of the aforementioned New York times expose, Visa and Mastercard banned PornHub <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://nypost.com/2020/12/09/pornhub-cracks-down-on-illegal-content-following-ny-times-expose/">8</a>.</span> On December 14 2020 Pornhub deleted ALL user generated PornHub videos. Today, only verified porn actors are allowed on PornHub, content creators are required to upload a government ID to prove they are of legal age. PornHub wrote "This means every piece of Pornhub content is from verified uploaders, a requirement that platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat and Twitter have yet to institute. <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pornhub.com/blog/11422">9</a>"</span> Google and Apple are strict enforcers of their own Terms of Service, when Fortnite broke a rule, Google and Apple deleted Fortnite from their app stores <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/fortnite-banned-from-apple-and-google-app-stores-and-developer-epic-sues/">10</a>.</span> Why are Twitter and Reddit allowed to break the rules? The answer is something illegal and corrupt is happening.</p>

<p class="two">The theory of race being a social construct originated from a 1972 science article titled "The Apportionment of Human Diversity" by Richard Lewontin. All humans carry the same 99.9% identical DNA, 00.1% creates all the diversity. Richard Lewontin concluded of the 00.1% diversity, 85.4% are mutations truly unique per each individual, 14.6% coalesces humans into groups. Richard Lewontin observed of the 14.6%, 56.8% (8.3/14.6) did not fit the standard model of the human races. That is how Richard Lewontin supposedly debunked racism. My rebuttal is seen below at the definition of races that Richard Lewontin debunked. For example, he put Indians in the same category as Germans.<br><br>Richard Lewontin has a clear agenda with his quote "Human racial classification is of no social value and is positively destructive of social and human relations." The irony is Richard Lewontin's study proved biological races are real. However, the races should not be based on skin color, but should instead be based on genetic codes. Richard Lewontin acknowledges the Karitiana and Surui tribes that live within 500 miles of each other, sharing the same environment, but their genetic differences are so drastic that they should be categorized as separate races. And yet according to the standard model, Karitiana and Surui are vaguely categorized as "amerindians." It is the same for white people, they can be divided into smaller and even smaller racial groups. So that is how 23AndMe divides white people into the haplogroups: British & Irish, Finnish, French & German, Scandinavian, Greek & Balkan, Italian, Sardinian, Spain & Portugal, Ashkenazi Jewish.<br><br><img src="lewontin.webp"></p>


<p class="two"><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/H3_Podcast_133_-_Biggest_Fail_In_History_Of_YouTube_Audio_REEXPORT.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=1062.8,1106" type="audio/mpeg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span><br>On August 4 2019, the african-american scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson argued that we should be more worried about viral pandemics than mass shootings <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/1158074774297468928">2</a>,</span> so Ethan Klein went on a 20 minute rant where Ethan told Neil "Shut the fuck up <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1100">2</a>,</span> you fucking imbecile <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1272">3</a>,</span> you fuckin idiot <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1845">4</a>,</span> motherfucker <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=2044">4</a>!"</span> I edited this stonetoss photo below to depict why Ethan is racist. Ethan reffered to Neil as "Smoke the Grass Tyson <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1384">4</a>,"</span> white supremacists commonly depict blacks as drug addicts. Then Ethan made a racist impression of a black jamaican smoking marijuana. Ethan said "smoke deGrasse mon." "Mon" is a common phrase in jamaica. In 2019, marijuana was illegal in Jamaica, so literally Ethan described Jamaicans as criminals. Hila said "Yours truly <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=2044">4</a>,"</span> a reference to OJ Simpson's twitter bio, putting Neil Tyson in the same category as OJ Simpson. In a previous podcast, Ethan described OJ Simpson as "a known murderer <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/m5_ye2jGKdk?t=3950">4</a>,"</span> Ethan & Hila's employee Daniel Swerdlove described Neil Tyson as "This shit makes me miss Carl Sagan <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=2085">4</a>,"</span> "Shit" is a reference to Neil's skin color. That is so racist like they are saying that Neil Tyson is unoriginal and an imitation of a white scientist. And the craziest part is Neil Tyson's rhetoric was correct all along because a few months later the coronavirus pandemic began.<br><br>Ethan's main argument is that there is nothing we can do to prevent viral pandemics, the best we can do is hope that a scientist finds a cure, but we could easily pass gun reform laws to defeat white supremacy. Ethan is wrong. There is so much we can do to prevent viral pandemics. All viral pandemics orginate from meat consumption, if everyone stopped eating meat, there would be far fewer pandemics. The process is called zoonosis, when the blood of two species touch, it causes viral mutations. That is why coronavirus orginated from bats, as bats drink blood it mixes bloods from different species. The virus doesn't mutate in the bat's stomach, stomach acid kills viruses, but instead the virus mutates on the bat's teeth and face. Bats infect livestock, and the livestock infects humans. A pandemics starts when a human has a tiny cut on their hand while handling raw bloody meat, so when the human blood touches the animal's blood. Zika virus, West Nile virus, and Yellow Fever virus all orginated from mosquitos, mosquitos drink blood. The Bubonic Plague originated from fleas, fleas drink blood. The only reason a human would handle raw meat is because they are trying to eat it. Most scientists agree HIV originated from consumption of monkey meat, PBS.org says "The majority of HIV researchers subscribe to the bushmeat theory. <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/aids/virus/origins.html">4</a>.</span>" Also, most scientists agree that tuberculosis, leprosy, cholera, smallpox, measles, influenza, the common cold, syphilis, ebola, it all originated from meat consumption <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="http://www3.carleton.ca/fecpl/courses/Reading%202.pdf">4</a>.</span> The Spanish Flu originated from consumption of pigs and poultry. The meat slaughter industry is so disgusting with feces and blood, the perfect condition for virus mutations, so slaughterhouses are powerwashed with antibiotics to prevent pandemics, and 80% of antibiotics is consumed for the meat industry <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://ourworldindata.org/antibiotic-resistance-from-livestock">4</a>.</span> The World Health Organization says "Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today. <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antibiotic-resistance">6</a>"</span><br><img src="ethan.webp"></p>
