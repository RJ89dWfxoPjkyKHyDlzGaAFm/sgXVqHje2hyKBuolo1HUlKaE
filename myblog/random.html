<h1>Deleted Audio Intro</h1>

<p class="two">Whenever Ethan Klein is caught saying racist things, Ethan uses Youtube's Creative Studio Video Editor "Trim <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/4hGe9KmRr4s">1</a>"</span> feature to trim out the specific racist minutes without deleting the entire Youtube video. But he doesn't delete things from the podcast RSS.</p>

<h1>Deleted Audio #1</h1>
<p class="two">"#4 - iDubbbzTV," Ethan Klein said the N word. Interestingly, Ethan did not delete the video of himself saying the N word. However, in "#29 - Jacksfilms & Erik of Internet Comment Etiquette," Ethan went on a 20 minute drunken rant defending his usage of the N word, and Ethan did delete this. The timestamp is 03:18:49. to 03:39:00. <br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/audio_only_idubbbz.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=309,324" type="audio/mp3">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/audio_only_idubbbz.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=455,471" type="audio/mp3">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span><br><audio controls preload="none"><source src="deleted.webm" type="audio/mp3">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></p>


<h1>Deleted Audio #2</h1>

<p class="two">"#145 - We Actually Stormed Area 51," Ethan participated in a meet and greet at Rip-n-dip, and was surprised when the security guards were 6'5 black men.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/H3_Podcast_145_-_Area_51_AUDIO.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=1227,1275" type="audio/mpeg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span><br>Ethan apologized for the above audio clip in "Jake Paul Arrested For Looting & The Karen Invasion - H3 Podcast #193 <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/MJVM5bWcbgk?t=8986">1</a>."</span> Ethan claimed the racist clip was taken out of context. However, if you listen to the full audio, it is in context.</p>
<h1>Deleted Audio #3</h1>
<p class="two">"Old People Angry About "OK Boomer" & FaZe Jarvis - H3 Podcast #156," Ethan theorized that blacks love fried chicken. <br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/H3_Podcast_156_AUDIO.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=4734,5032" type="audio/mpeg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>

<h1>Deleted Audio #4</h1>
<p class="two">"#164 - We're In YouTube Rewind," Ethan criticized the BTS boyband. #h3h3isoverparty was trending on twitter, and so Ethan deleted this xenophobic clip. Then Ethan made an entire 1.5 hour podcast where Ethan refused to apologize, the episode was called "#165 - K-pop Stans Cancel Us On Twitter <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/theh3podcast/status/1204816651809542144">1</a>"</span> and Youtube deleted it for xenophobia.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/h3_podcast_164_reexport_AUDIO.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=1544,1566" type="audio/mpeg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>

<h1>Deleted Audio #5</h1>
<p class="two">"#83 - Meme Royale & PewDiePie vs T-Series," Ethan described Indians like janitors, many Indians on Youtube and Reddit were offended and so Ethan deleted this clip.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/H3_Podcast_-_TotW_Meme_Royale_and_PewDiePie_vs_T-Series_-_04_September_2018_-_03-00-17_PM.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=4132,4142" type="audio/mpeg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>

<p class="two">According to Global Wealth Report <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/global-wealth-report.html">1</a>,</span> all the world's wealth in 2019 added up to a grand total of 399.179 trillion in U.S. dollars. In 2019 there were 7.674 billion humans. If we evenly distribute all of the world's wealth, then each human would have a net worth of $52,017. If your net worth is worth more than $52,017 then you are contributing to wealth inequality. If your net worth is $52,017 then you are oppressing noone. If your net worth is $52,017 times 3, then you are oppressing 2 humans. And so on. For example, the world's wealthiest is Jeff Bezos who has a net worth of $187.5 billion. Jeff Bezos is oppressing 3,604,585 humans. Trevor Noah's net worth is $100 million, so Trevor Noah is oppressing 1,922 humans. 1,922 humans are struggling to pay rent and nearly starving to death because of Trevor Noah's greed. The oppressors are billionaires, millionaires, AND hundred-thousandaires. 12.4% of adults have a net worth greater than $100,000. <img src="global-wealth-report-2020-en.webp" max-width="100%" max-height="100%"></p>

<p class="two">The theory of race being a social construct originated from a 1972 science article titled "The Apportionment of Human Diversity" by Richard Lewontin. Richard Lewontin categorized humans based on their genetics, and realized 56.8% of categorizations did not fit the standard model of the human races. That is how Richard Lewontin supposedly debunked racism. My rebuttal is seen below at the definition of races that Richard Lewontin debunked. For example, he put Indians in the same category as Germans.<br><br><img src="lewontin.webp"></p>


<p class="two"><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/H3_Podcast_133_-_Biggest_Fail_In_History_Of_YouTube_Audio_REEXPORT.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=1062.8,1106" type="audio/mpeg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span><br>On August 4 2019, the african-american scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson argued that we should be more worried about viral pandemics than mass shootings <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/1158074774297468928">2</a>,</span> so Ethan Klein went on a 20 minute rant where Ethan told Neil "Shut the fuck up <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1100">2</a>,</span> you fucking imbecile <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1272">3</a>,</span> you fuckin idiot <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1845">4</a>,</span> motherfucker <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=2044">4</a>!"</span> I edited this stonetoss photo below to depict why Ethan is racist. Ethan reffered to Neil as "Smoke the Grass Tyson <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1384">4</a>,"</span> white supremacists commonly depict blacks as drug addicts. Then Ethan made a racist impression of a black jamaican smoking marijuana. Ethan said "smoke deGrasse mon." "Mon" is a common phrase in jamaica. In 2019, marijuana was illegal in Jamaica, so literally Ethan described Jamaicans as criminals. Hila said "Yours truly <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=2044">4</a>,"</span> a reference to OJ Simpson's twitter bio, putting Neil Tyson in the same category as OJ Simpson. In a previous podcast, Ethan described OJ Simpson as "a known murderer <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/m5_ye2jGKdk?t=3950">4</a>,"</span> Ethan & Hila's employee Daniel Swerdlove described Neil Tyson as "This shit makes me miss Carl Sagan <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=2085">4</a>,"</span> "Shit" is a reference to Neil's skin color. That is so racist like they are saying that Neil Tyson is unoriginal and an imitation of a white scientist. And the craziest part is Neil Tyson's rhetoric was correct all along because a few months later the coronavirus pandemic began.<br><br>Ethan's main argument is that there is nothing we can do to prevent viral pandemics, the best we can do is hope that a scientist finds a cure, but we could easily pass gun reform laws to defeat white supremacy. Ethan is wrong. There is so much we can do to prevent viral pandemics. All major viral pandemics orginated from meat consumption, if everyone stopped eating meat, there would be far fewer pandemics. The process is called zoonosis, when the blood of two animals touch, it causes viral mutations. That is why coronavirus originated from bats, as bats drink blood it mixes bloods from different animals. Bats infect livestock, and then the livestock infects humans. A pandemics starts when a human has a tiny cut on their hand while handling raw bloody meat, so when the human blood touches the animal's blood. Zika virus, West Nile virus, and Yellow Fever virus all orginated from mosquitos, mosquitos drink blood. The Bubonic Plague originated from fleas, fleas drink blood. The zoonosis process is why most scientists agree HIV originated from humans eating monkey meat, PBS.org says "The majority of HIV researchers subscribe to the bushmeat theory. <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/aids/virus/origins.html">4</a>.</span>" Also, most scientists agree that tuberculosis, leprosy, cholera, smallpox, measles, influenza, the common cold, syphilis, ebola, it all originated from humans eating meat <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="http://www3.carleton.ca/fecpl/courses/Reading%202.pdf">4</a>.</span> The Spanish Flu originated from consumption of pigs and poultry. Slaughterhouses are so disgusting with feces and blood, the perfect condition for virus mutations, that these slaughterhouses are powerwashed with antibiotics to prevent pandemics, and 80% of antibiotics is consumed for the meat industry <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://ourworldindata.org/antibiotic-resistance-from-livestock">4</a>.</span> The World Health Organization says "Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today. <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antibiotic-resistance">6</a>"<br></span><br><img src="ethan.webp"><br>Scientists interviewed 327 hunters in Africa, and 29% of hunters basically responded "I am aware that hunting animals causes viral pandemics such as HIV. I am aware of zoonosis, we all learn about zoonosis from the mainstream media. I just don't give a fuck. I want to hunt animals. Hunting animals is the oldest tradition of my heritage and my culture." So there you have it. You shouldn't believe those liberals who preach "Education is the key to fixing all the world's problems." Try this experiment, the next time you see someone throwing trash on the floor, ask them "Did you know that littering is bad for the environment?" And they will respond "I am aware that littering is bad for animals and the environment. I just don't give a fuck. I want to litter." If you asked a billionaire "Did you know that your business model is bad for the economy?" A billionaire would say to himself "I am aware that my employees are underpaid. I am aware that my business contributes towards Global Warming. I am aware that I can mitigate those things. I learned about all those things while I was in college. I just don't give a fuck. I would rather be a billionaire, it's more awesome."</p>
