<p>In 2019, the african-american scientist named Neil deGrasse Tyson shared his own unique black perspective on twitter <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/1158074774297468928">1</a>,</span> Neil Tyson argued that we should worry more about viral pandemics than mass shootings, so Ethan went on a 20 minute rant against Neil where Ethan told Neil "Shut the fuck up <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1100">2</a>,</span> you fucking imbecile<span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1263">3</a></span> you fuckin idiot <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1843">4</a>,</span> motherfucker <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=2042">5</a>!</span>" I edited this stonetoss photo to depict why Ethan is racist <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="ethan.webp">6</a>!</span>. It gets worse. Ethan reffered to Neil as "Smoke the Grass Tyson," white supremacists commonly depict blacks as drug addicts. Then Ethan made a racist impression of a black jamaican smoking marijuana, Ethan said "smoke deGrasse mon." "Mon" is a common phrase in jamaica. In 2019, marijuana was illegal in Jaimaica, so literally Ethan described Jamaicans as criminals. Then Hila Klein compared Neil to OJ Simpson. In previous podcasts, Ethan described OJ Simpson as "a known murderer." Ethan and Hila put Neil Tyson in the same category as OJ Simpson. And the craziest part is Neil Tyson's rhetoric was correct all along because a few months later the coronavirus pandemic began.</p>

<p>Ethan and Hila constantly talk about politics on twitter and the H3 podcast. So far Ethan and Hila have spoken nothing about the war in Israel, and I think I know why. Listen to this audio of Hila talking about terrorism in Israel. It's clear that Hila views Palestines as terrorists. I am telling you Ethan and Hila are racist as fuck. The beep sound indicates the sections I cropped out, so you can tell I am not creating Frankenbites. Listen to the full podcast episode for better context.</p>

<p>Ethan condemns the "white supremacists" who refuce to accept the verdict of Derek Chauvin's trial <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/bfKPts4BJkA?t=1976">1</a>,</span>. But yet Ethan himself refuses to accept the verdict of OJ Simpson's trial, Ethan said "We have to remember that this guy is a literal murderer, he visciously killed two people with a knife, and cut their heads off." Ethan continued "Do we all agree that OJ Simpson is guilty? I love how everyone points to the justice system as the end all be all." Dan replied "It's a fundamental misunderstanding. When you are acquitted, it doesn't mean you are innocent. That's why they call it not guilty." Ethan said this about Michael Jackson "I'm a critic of Michael Jackson, I think he is a filthy pedo." Ethan accussed a random black man named Patrice Wilson of being a pedo, the only evidence Ethan had is Patrice was a "creepy guy with a pedo vibe." So basically the only evidence Ethan had is Patrice Wilson is a black man, so therefore he must be a criminal. Due to Ethan's false accusations, Patrice Wilson felt suicidal. And Ethan accuses R Kelly of being a pedo. So there you have it, Ethan Klein accused four (legally) innocent black men. False accusations against innocent blacks is the exact definition of racism. Ethan Klein is racist, but he pretends to be an ally. I am currently researching the timestamps for everything.</p>

<p>Also, Ethan is sexist as fuck!! <p>In this episode <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/gTV5B1lBG_M?t=1107">6</a>,</span> Ethan briefly introduced the topic about a female mass shooter named Nasim Najafi Aghdam. Ethan said "But Bobby just arrived. We can talk about it next time." Ethan ended the topic because he had a guest there. There was another episode of Ethan talking in depth about Nasim, but I am certain it got deleted. Nasim had a youtube channel, and when she perpetrated a mass shooting, her youtube channel got deleted. And since Ethan was sharing Nasim's videos, maybe youtube's terms of service forced Ethan to delete it. But if I remember it correctly, Ethan said "I am sorry, I am just going to say it how it is. Nasim was a fucking bitch, her youtube channel was fucking weird! Nasim loved animals, she was a vegan. Meat is murder, and do you know what else is murder? Murder is murder." Even on Joe Rogan's podcast, Brendan Schaub said this about Nasim "That bitch was definitely out of her mind <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/3gZQOJxptyc?t=2">7</a>.</span>" Ethan was following a trend of calling Nasim a "bitch." For about 20 minutes, Ethan attacked Nasim's personality. Then, all of sudden one month later Ethan is reacting to a male mass shooter <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/baC2qEuel6Y">8</a>.</span>, and Ethan was all like "This country has a gun reform problem, and the media is promoting mass shootings." When a female is a mass shooter Ethan blames the shooter, but when a male is a mass shooter Ethan blames the media and our government.</p>
