<h1>Deleted Audio Intro</h1>

<p class="two">Whenever Ethan Klein is caught saying racist things, Ethan uses Youtube's Creative Studio Video Editor "Trim <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/4hGe9KmRr4s">1</a>"</span> feature to trim out the specific racist minutes without deleting the entire Youtube video. But he doesn't delete things from his podcast RSS.</p>

<h1>Deleted Audio #1</h1>
<p class="two">"#4 - iDubbbzTV," Ethan Klein said the N word. Interestingly, Ethan did not delete the video of himself saying the N word. However, in "#29 - Jacksfilms & Erik of Internet Comment Etiquette," Ethan went on a 20 minute drunken rant defending his usage of the N word, and Ethan did delete this. The timestamp is 03:18:49. to 03:39:00. <br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/audio_only_idubbbz.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=309,324" type="audio/ogg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/audio_only_idubbbz.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=455,471" type="audio/ogg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span><br><audio controls preload="none"><source src="deleted.webm" type="audio/ogg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></p>

<p>According to Global Wealth Report <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/global-wealth-report.html">1</a>,</span> all the world's wealth in 2019 added up to a grand total of 399.179 trillion U.S. dollars. In 2019 there were 7.674 billion humans. If we distribute all of the world's wealth evenly, then each human would have a net worth of $52,017. If your net worth is worth more than $52,017 then you are contributing to wealth inequality. If your net worth is $52,017 then you are oppressing noone. If your net worth is $52,017 times 3, then you are oppressing 2 humans. And so on. For example, the world's wealthiest is Jeff Bezos who has a net worth of $187.5 billion. Jeff Bezos is oppressing 3,604,589 humans. Trevor Noah's net worth is $100 million, so Trevor Noah is oppressing 1,921 humans. 1,921 humans are struggling to pay rent and nearly starving to death because of Trevor Noah's greed. 12.4% of humans have a net worth greater than $100,000, so 12.4% of humans are oppressors. The oppressors are billionaires, millionaires, AND hundred-thousandaires. <img src="global-wealth-report-2020-en.webp" max-width="100%" max-height="100%"></p>
