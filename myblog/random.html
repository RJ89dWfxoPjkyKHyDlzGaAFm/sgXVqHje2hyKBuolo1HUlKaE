<h1>Deleted Audio Intro</h1>

<p class="two">Whenever Ethan Klein is caught saying racist things, Ethan uses Youtube's Creative Studio Video Editor "Trim <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/4hGe9KmRr4s">1</a>"</span> feature to trim out the specific racist minutes without deleting the entire Youtube video. But he doesn't delete things from the podcast RSS.</p>

<h1>Deleted Audio #1</h1>
<p class="two">"#4 - iDubbbzTV," Ethan Klein said the N word. Interestingly, Ethan did not delete the video of himself saying the N word. However, in "#29 - Jacksfilms & Erik of Internet Comment Etiquette," Ethan went on a 20 minute drunken rant defending his usage of the N word, and Ethan did delete this. The timestamp is 03:18:49. to 03:39:00. <br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/audio_only_idubbbz.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=309,324" type="audio/ogg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/audio_only_idubbbz.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=455,471" type="audio/ogg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span><br><audio controls preload="none"><source src="deleted.webm" type="audio/ogg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></p>


<h1>Deleted Audio #2</h1>

<p class="two">"#145 - We Actually Stormed Area 51," Ethan participated in a meet and greet at Rip-n-dip, and was surprised when the security guards were 6'5 black men.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/H3_Podcast_145_-_Area_51_AUDIO.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=1227,1275" type="audio/ogg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span><br>Ethan apologized for the above audio clip in "Jake Paul Arrested For Looting & The Karen Invasion - H3 Podcast #193 <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/MJVM5bWcbgk?t=8986">1</a>."</span> Ethan claimed the racist clip was taken out of context. However, if you listen to the full audio, it is in context.</p>
<h1>Deleted Audio #3</h1>
<p class="two">"Old People Angry About "OK Boomer" & FaZe Jarvis - H3 Podcast #156," Ethan theorized that blacks love fried chicken. <br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/H3_Podcast_156_AUDIO.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=4734,5032" type="audio/ogg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>

<h1>Deleted Audio #4</h1>
<p class="two">"#164 - We're In YouTube Rewind," Ethan criticized the BTS boyband. #h3h3isoverparty was trending on twitter, and so Ethan deleted this xenophobic clip. Then Ethan made an entire 1.5 hour podcast where Ethan refused to apologize, the episode was called "#165 - K-pop Stans Cancel Us On Twitter <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/theh3podcast/status/1204816651809542144">1</a>"</span> and Youtube deleted it for xenophobia.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/h3_podcast_164_reexport_AUDIO.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=1544,1566" type="audio/mpeg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>

<h1>Deleted Audio #5</h1>
<p class="two">"#83 - Meme Royale & PewDiePie vs T-Series," Ethan described Indians like janitors, many Indians on Youtube and Reddit were offended and so Ethan deleted this clip.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/h3h3roost/H3_Podcast_-_TotW_Meme_Royale_and_PewDiePie_vs_T-Series_-_04_September_2018_-_03-00-17_PM.mp3?dest-id=556650#t=4132,4142" type="audio/mpeg">You need Google Chrome to listen to libopus audio files.</audio></span></p>

<p class="two">According to Global Wealth Report <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/global-wealth-report.html">1</a>,</span> all the world's wealth in 2019 added up to a grand total of 399.179 trillion in U.S. dollars. In 2019 there were 7.674 billion humans. If we evenly distribute all of the world's wealth, then each human would have a net worth of $52,017. If your net worth is worth more than $52,017 then you are contributing to wealth inequality. If your net worth is $52,017 then you are oppressing noone. If your net worth is $52,017 times 3, then you are oppressing 2 humans. And so on. For example, the world's wealthiest is Jeff Bezos who has a net worth of $187.5 billion. Jeff Bezos is oppressing 3,604,585 humans. Trevor Noah's net worth is $100 million, so Trevor Noah is oppressing 1,922 humans. 1,922 humans are struggling to pay rent and nearly starving to death because of Trevor Noah's greed. The oppressors are billionaires, millionaires, AND hundred-thousandaires. 12.4% of adults have a net worth greater than $100,000. <img src="global-wealth-report-2020-en.webp" max-width="100%" max-height="100%"></p>

<h1>Twitter and Reddit</h1>
<p class="two">According to Apple <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#1.1.4">1</a></span> and Google <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9878810/inappropriate-content">2</a>,</span> porn is not allowed on their app stores. That is why you cannot find PornHub and OnlyFans in the official Android and iPhone app stores. According to Twitter <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/media-policy">3</a></span> and Reddit <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#1.1.4">4</a>,</span> porn is allowed on Twitter and Reddit. That means Twitter and Reddit are openly pornographic apps. Legally speaking, Twitter and Reddit should be banned from Android and iPhone.<br><br>On November 16 2018, Apple banned Tumblr because of underaged porn <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104366/tumblr-ios-app-child-pornography-removed-from-app-store">5</a></span>. In order to remain on the Apple App Store, on December 3 2018 Tumblr outright banned ALL Tumblr porn <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123752/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-date-explicit-changes-why-safe-mode">6</a>.</span> On December 4 2020 New York Times exposed the millions of underaged porn on Reddit, Twitter, Google, and Pornhub <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html">7</a>.</span> As a direct consequence of the aforementioned New York times expose, Visa and Mastercard banned PornHub <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://nypost.com/2020/12/09/pornhub-cracks-down-on-illegal-content-following-ny-times-expose/">8</a>.</span> On December 14 2020 Pornhub deleted ALL user generated PornHub videos. Today, only verified porn actors are allowed on PornHub, content creators are required to upload a government ID to prove they are of legal age. PornHub wrote "This means every piece of Pornhub content is from verified uploaders, a requirement that platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat and Twitter have yet to institute. <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pornhub.com/blog/11422">9</a>"</span> Google and Apple are strict enforcers of their own Terms of Service, when Fortnite broke a rule, Google and Apple deleted Fortnite from their app stores <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/fortnite-banned-from-apple-and-google-app-stores-and-developer-epic-sues/">10</a>.</span> Why are Twitter and Reddit allowed to break the rules? The answer is something illegal and corrupt is happening.</p>

<p class="two">The theory of race being a social construct originated from a 1972 science article titled "The Apportionment of Human Diversity" by Richard Lewontin. All humans carry the same 99.9% identical DNA, 00.1% created all the diversity. Richard Lewontin concluded of the 00.1% diversity, 85.4% are mutations unique per individual, 14.6% coalesced into racial groupings. Richard Lewontin observed the 14.6%, and realized 56.8% (8.3/14.6) did not fit the standard model of the human races. Therefore, Richard Lewontin debunked racism. My rebuttal is seen below at the definition of races that Richard Lewontin debunked. For example, he put Indians in the same category as Germans. The only thing Richard Lewontin proved is that you can group people into races based on genetics, but that these new races might not be based on skin color.<br><br><img src="lewontin.webp"></p>
