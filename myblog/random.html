<p>In 2019, the african-american scientist named Neil deGrasse Tyson shared his own unique black perspective on twitter <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/1158074774297468928">1</a>,</span> Neil Tyson argued that we should worry more about viral pandemics than mass shootings, so Ethan went on a 20 minute rant against Neil where Ethan told Neil "Shut the fuck up <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1100">2</a>,</span> you fucking imbecile <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1272">3</a>,</span> you fuckin idiot <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1845">4</a>,</span> motherfucker <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=2044">4</a>!"</span> I edited this stonetoss photo to depict why Ethan is racist <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="ethan.webp">3</a>.</span> Ethan reffered to Neil as "Smoke the Grass Tyson <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1384">4</a>,"</span> white supremacists commonly depict blacks as drug addicts. Then Ethan made a racist impression of a black jamaican smoking marijuana, Ethan said "smoke deGrasse mon." "Mon" is a common phrase in jamaica. In 2019, marijuana was illegal in Jamaica, so literally Ethan described Jamaicans as criminals. Hila said "Yours truly <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=2044">4</a>,"</span> a reference to OJ Simpson's twitter bio, putting Neil Tyson in the same category as OJ Simpson. In a previous podcast, Ethan described OJ Simpson as "a known murderer <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/m5_ye2jGKdk?t=3950">4</a>,"</span> Ethan & Hilas employee named Daniel Swerdlove described Neil Tyson as "This shit makes me miss Carl Sagan <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=2085">4</a>,"</span> "Shit" is a reference to Neil's skin color. That is so racist like they are saying that Neil Tyson is unoriginal and an imitation of a white scientist. And the craziest part is Neil Tyson's rhetoric was correct all along because a few months later the coronavirus pandemic began.</p>
<h1>Ethan is Racist</h1>
<p>Ethan condemned the "white supremacists" who refused to accept the verdict of Derek Chauvin's trial <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/bfKPts4BJkA?t=1976">1</a>.</span> Ironically, Ethan himself refused to accept the verdict of OJ Simpson's trial, Ethan said "We have to remember that this guy is a literal murderer, he visciously killed two people with a knife, and cut their heads off. <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/UA34AS9XtbU?t=4541">8</a>"</span> Ethan continued "Do we all agree that OJ Simpson is guilty? I love how everyone points to the justice system as the end all be all. <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/q73TtQLC-W4?t=5821">9</a></span>" Dan replied "It's a fundamental misunderstanding. When you are acquitted, it doesn't mean you are innocent. That's why they call it not guilty." Ethan said this about Michael Jackson "I'm a critic of Michael Jackson, I think he is a filthy pedo <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/rwhVqYVZHqI?t=2526">1</a>."</span> Ethan described R Kelly as "That dude is a creep, I mean listen guys, it's public knowledge that he was boning Aaliyah when she was like 14 or 15 <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/B29sPyBo3_I?t=4676">1</a>."</span> And Ethan accused Patrice Wilson of being a pedo. So there you have it, Ethan Klein accused four (legally) innocent black men. False accusations against innocent blacks is the exact definition of racism. According to the Presumption of Innocence law, everyone is innocent until proven guilty. According to the Double Jeopardy law, once you are acquitted of a crime, you are innocent forever. Ethan Klein is racist, but he pretends to be an ally. If you're not convinced that Ethan and Hila are racist, listen to this audio clip of them discussing purbred animals. They believe certain races of animals are superior.</p>
