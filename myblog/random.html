<p>In 2019, the african-american scientist named Neil deGrasse Tyson shared his own unique black perspective on twitter <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/1158074774297468928">1</a>,</span> Neil Tyson argued that we should worry more about viral pandemics than mass shootings, so Ethan went on a 20 minute rant against Neil where Ethan told Neil "Shut the fuck up <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pKt615DRnV4?t=1100">2</a>,</span> you fucking imbecile, you fuckin idiot, motherfucker!" I edited this stonetoss photo to depict why Ethan is racist <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="ethan.webp">3</a>.</span> Ethan reffered to Neil as "Smoke the Grass Tyson," white supremacists commonly depict blacks as drug addicts. Then Ethan made a racist impression of a black jamaican smoking marijuana, Ethan said "smoke deGrasse mon." "Mon" is a common phrase in jamaica. In 2019, marijuana was illegal in Jaimaica, so literally Ethan described Jamaicans as criminals. Ethan and Hila put Neil Tyson in the same category as OJ Simpson. In previous podcasts, Ethan described OJ Simpson as "a known murderer." Ethan and Hila prefer the white scientist named Carl Sagan instead of Neil Tyson, that is so racist like they are saying that Neil Tyson is unoriginal and an imitation of a white scientist. And the craziest part is Neil Tyson's rhetoric was correct all along because a few months later the coronavirus pandemic began. Ebola also comes from killing animals. Avian flu comes from killing chickens. Swine Flu comes from killing pigs. Meat slaughter is so disguting that is why antibiotics are used in animal slaughters because theres blood and feces everywhere and all the animals are dying prematurely. Our World in Data said 80% of antibiotics is used soley for meat consumption. And the World Health Organization said "Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today." So as long as humans keep eating meat there will always be another pandemic.</p>

<p>Ethan's main argument is that pandemics are random and there is nothing we can do to prevent pandemics. But Ethan is wrong. Did you know that all pandemics began because of meat consumption? It's true. Viruses begin whenever there is animal blood to human blood cross contamination. The process is called Zoonosis which is when the blood from one species touches the blood of a different species for long periods of time. Bats and mosquitos transmit diseases to humans because both bats and mosquitos eat blood. HIV started because humans were eating monkeys and some of those humans probably had a cut on their hands as they were cutting monkey meat. Coronavirus most likely originated in Huanan Seafood Market because they were dead animals everywhere so there was blood cross contamination.

<p>Ethan and Hila constantly talk about politics on twitter and the H3 podcast. So far Ethan and Hila have spoken nothing about the war in Israel, and I think I know why. Listen to this audio of Hila talking about terrorism in Israel. It's clear that Hila views Palestines as terrorists. I am telling you Ethan and Hila are racist as fuck. The beep sound indicates the sections I cropped out, so you can tell I am not creating Frankenbites. Listen to the full podcast episode for better context.</p>

<p>Ethan condemns the "white supremacists" who refused to accept the verdict of Derek Chauvin's trial <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/bfKPts4BJkA?t=1976">1</a>,</span>. But yet Ethan himself refused to accept the verdict of OJ Simpson's trial, Ethan said "We have to remember that this guy is a literal murderer, he visciously killed two people with a knife, and cut their heads off. <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/UA34AS9XtbU?t=4541">8</a>.</span>" Ethan continued "Do we all agree that OJ Simpson is guilty? I love how everyone points to the justice system as the end all be all. <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/q73TtQLC-W4?t=5821">9</a>.</span>" Dan replied "It's a fundamental misunderstanding. When you are acquitted, it doesn't mean you are innocent. That's why they call it not guilty." Ethan said this about Michael Jackson "I'm a critic of Michael Jackson, I think he is a filthy pedo <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/rwhVqYVZHqI?t=2526">10</a>.</span>." Ethan accussed a random black man named Patrice Wilson of being a pedo, the only evidence Ethan had is Patrice was a "creepy guy with a pedo vibe." So basically the only evidence Ethan had is Patrice Wilson was a black man, so therefore Patrice should be a criminal. Due to Ethan's false accusations, Patrice Wilson uploaded a video titled "#_o_o_o=65lt@66-6-h3h3 The Final Moment!!!!!" In the now deleted video Patrice Wilson described how Ethan Klein's constant bullying and false accusations caused Patrice to lose his jobs, house, and cars. The public harrassed Patrice, and it made Patrice want to committ suicide, so Patrice coped with the bullying by dissociating his own personality into symbolisms. And Ethan accuses R Kelly of being a pedo. So there you have it, Ethan Klein accused four (legally) innocent black men. False accusations against innocent blacks is the exact definition of racism. According to the Presumption of Innocence law, everyone is innocent until proven guilty. According to the Double Jeopardy law, once you are acquitted of a crime, you are innocent forever. Ethan Klein is racist, but he pretends to be an ally. I am currently researching the timestamps for everything.</p>

<p>If you're not convinced that Ethan and Hila re racist, listen to this audio clip of them discussing purbred animals. They believe certain races of animals are superior.</p>

<p>Also, Ethan is sexist as fuck!! <p>In this episode <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/gTV5B1lBG_M?t=1107">6</a>,</span> Ethan briefly introduced the topic about a female mass shooter named Nasim Najafi Aghdam. Ethan said "But Bobby just arrived. We can talk about it next time." Ethan ended the topic because he had a guest there. There was another episode of Ethan talking in depth about Nasim, but I am certain it got deleted. Nasim had a youtube channel, and when she perpetrated a mass shooting, her youtube channel got deleted. And since Ethan was sharing Nasim's videos, maybe youtube's terms of service forced Ethan to delete it. But if I remember it correctly, Ethan said "I am sorry, I am just going to say it how it is. Nasim was a fucking bitch, her youtube channel was fucking weird! Nasim loved animals, she was a vegan. Meat is murder, and do you know what else is murder? Murder is murder." Even on Joe Rogan's podcast, Brendan Schaub said this about Nasim "That bitch was definitely out of her mind <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/3gZQOJxptyc?t=2">7</a>.</span>" Ethan was following a trend of calling Nasim a "bitch." For about 20 minutes, Ethan attacked Nasim's personality. Then, all of sudden one month later Ethan is reacting to a male mass shooter <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/baC2qEuel6Y">8</a>.</span>, and Ethan was all like "This country has a gun reform problem, and the media is promoting mass shootings." When a female is a mass shooter Ethan blames the shooter, but when a male is a mass shooter Ethan blames the media and our government.</p> 



<p>Ethan is homophobic <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/ABT5w_LNtx8?t=480">8</a>!!</span> Ethan believes there is a Tik-Tok and Twitter conspiracy to protect James Charles because Tik-Tok and Twitter is banning people who accuse James Charles of being a pedo. Ethan is constantly accusing James Charles of being a pedo, so naturally Ethan's Tik-Toks about James Charles are systemically deleted, and for a good reason. The truth is Ethan's Tik-Toks are being deleted because Ethan is being homophobic. There was a scientific article that said 50% of pedos abused the same sex, and because less than 5% of people identify as LGBT, according to homophobic people, they say that means LGBT are significantly more likely to be pedos. It was a real science article, but I forgot to bookmark it, because I thought it was stupid. I analyzed the science and realized the article only proves that pedos are not after sexual desire, it's about hatred and power, and that is why they don't care about the gender of their victims, they will abuse anything, pedos abuse indiscriminately. So that is why Ethan is homophobic, he is accussing a random gay man of being a pedo. And it gets worse, Ethan wants to deplatform James Charles and Keemstar. In reality it's Ethan who should be deplatformed.</p>
