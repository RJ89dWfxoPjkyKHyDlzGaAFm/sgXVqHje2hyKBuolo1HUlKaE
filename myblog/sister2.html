<p>My sister is the #1 reason why I am disgusted by the Black Lives Matter movement. So here goes her story. It's not just my sister, it's her boyfriend, it's all their friends. All of them openly say things like "I hate all white people."</p>

<h1>Toilet Video</h1>
<p>When I was a kid, I was toilet trained at a very late age. I was afraid of pooping in stranger's homes. So there I was one day pooping in my grandmother's, I finally did it, I was trained. I felt safe. My door was locked. Then, out of nowhere my unlocked my bathroom door with a kitchen knife, my sister kicked open my bathroom door in the middle of my poop! My sister held a camera to my face, she laughed at me, she recorded me pooping. I was crying. I threw a massive tantrum while on the toilet. I grabbed the febreeze spray and sprayed it into the air wishing the spray droplets obscured my private parts. Then, my sister ran away with her camera laughing. She left the door wide open. I finished wiping myself. Then, when I stepped outside my sister was demonically laughing at my video and showing everyone the video of me pooping. She showed the video to her friend, and her friend said "Your brother's reaction was funny. But that was really messed up, you're bullying him" My sister replied "Haha shut the f**k up stupid b**ch."</p>

<h1>Shower Prank</h1>
<p>When I was a kid, I was just naked in the shower in my own home. Although, it was night time. I felt safe. My door was locked. I finally finished my hot steamy shower. I turned the hot water off. I was standing there naked. Then, out of nowhere my sister unlocked my bathroom door with a kitchen knife, my sister kicked open my bathroom door. This time my sister carried a 5 gallon bucket filled with water. My sister pushed my bathroom curtains aside, then she dumped cold water over my head. My sister was laughing like a demonic maniac. Then, she ran away and turned off my bathroom lights. I was standing there in the pitch darkness, naked, crying, and shivering. My sister planned all of this out. She was standing outside my bathroom door waiting for me to turn off my hot water so she could catch me at just the right moment.</p>

<h1>Methamphetamine</h1>
<p>So my sister was addicted to methamphetamine all through my childhood years. One time, I was watching television as the police appeared at my door. My parents asked me to go in my room. And basically I heard arguing because the police were there to investigate a murder which my sister witnessed somehow. And so when my sister saw the police, they started arguing, and then my sister removed all her clothes. Yeah, my sister was naked and running around in the streets high on methamphetamine and screaming "F**k the police! Haha, Help! The police is trying to rape me! Pigs!"</p>

<h1>Beer Bottles</h1>
<p>When I was a kid, one time my sister called my mother on the phone and my sister cried out "Help me, please mommy. You were right, I am afraid. Please, pick me up. I am in the middle of Watts, Los Angeles." My mother replied "You f**king b***h. You're a disgrace. I don't give a f**k about you." My mother hung up the phone. My sister had to find her own way home. My sister returned home in the middle of the night, she had blood on her back from broken shards of beer bottles. My sister had mentioned that she was drinking beer with a group of people in a white van, and when my sister started vomitting, they opened the van door and pushed her out of the vehicle. I am assuming she landed on broken beer bottles. I don't know.</p>

<h1>Nike Shoes</h1>
<p>When I was a kid, My sister had stacks of Nike Air Jordans. One day I was watching television, when I heard another knock at my door. I opened it, and there standing in front of me was a latina women who said to me "Hello, is your sister home?" I replied "My sister is not home right now." The latina woman replied "Oh, that's okay." She started walking away. I closed the door. Then, a few minutes later, I heard her knocking again, this time she seemed very nervous as she was saying "I let her borrow my shoes, and she promised to give them back today. I texted your sister, and she said I could pick them up myself. I know exactly where they are at." I shrugged and let her into my home, I sat down and watched television. I saw her walking back and forth several times. The next day my sister said to me "Where are all my shoes?! Oh, no. Jovanny, did a woman come in here and take all my shoes?" That was how I realized that woman stole all of my sister's Nike Air Jordan shoes.</p>

<h1>Rehabilitation</h1>
<p>My sister went through an extensive rehabilitation program to help her quit her methamphetamine addiction. It worked. Now many years later, my sister gave birth to 2 sons each with different fathers. It seemed like motherhood changed my sister for the better. It seemed...</p>

<h1>First Son</h1>
<p>My sister worships the black lives matter movement, and she hates nazis. The irony is she abuses her first child because of his genetics. Basically, my sister is afraid that one day her first son will become like his gangster latino father. For a while my sister forced her first son to take piano lessons. One day, he threw a tantrum because he did not want to be in piano lessons. So my sister hardcore beat him up. He was just a kid probably like 6 years old. One day, he drew a mustache and unibrow on himself with washable crayola markers. He said "Haha mommy look at my funny mustache and unibrow." So my sister hardcore beat him up because it reminded her of the gangster face tattoos his father had. And the worst part is my sister has huge tattoos all over her own body!</p>

<p>My sister hates the police so much. The irony is she is more afraid of her exboyfriend than the cops. Literally, she is terrified because her exboyfriend is coming out of prison soon, and he might kill her.</p>

<h1>Violent Party</h1>
<p>All throughout the coronavirus pandemic, my sister went to parties. Here's what my sister's first son told me, he was 9 years old and this is what he told me, I am paraphrasing so it makes more sense to my readers, he said "During the pandemic, my sister took me to many different parties. In one specific party, my step-father's friend was choking another man. One man kicked chairs and tables and started yelling at his girlfriend. The man who was yelling at his girlfriend was the most concerning thing to me. The situation got so bad. I thought someone was going to pull out a gun and start killing people. So I grabbed all the children and I pushed them to go inside a dog house. I stood in front of the dog house door to protect the children, I believed that I was going to die for them. My mother grabbed me, and my brother, and together we all ran to our car."</p>

<h1>Thanksgiving</h1>
<p>Several days before Thanksgiving 2020, my sister and her boyfriend went out and partied it up at Las Vegas, Nevada. They left their children at my mother's house. When the returned, my sister's boyfriend was diagnosed with coronavirus. He visited his distant relatives for Thanksgiving, knowing he had coronavirus. He was asymptomatic. When they returned from their Thanksgiving, my sister's first son said to me, I am paraphrasing for my readers, he said to me "My father's sister's boyfriend is named Henry. Henry is an adult latino man. Henry was arguing with his step-child about a bicycle. The step-child slammed a door in retaliation of Henry. The door slamming invited a larger argument among the other adults. Everyone was arguing. Then, Henry grabbed his girlfriend's car keys, and angrily drove away with her car. Henry stole his girlfriend's car. They called the police to report the stolen vehicle. When the police arrived, everyone started telling their stories about Henry. Two of Henry's step-children told the police that Henry had an extensive history of choking them. All three of Henry's step-children told the police that Henry had an extensive history of molestation, touching their private parts. One of Henry's step-children, said that her bathroom door had remained broken since the longest time, so while she was taking a shower, Henry walked in and said to her "Let me teach you how to bathe herself," and that was how he molested her. When the police left, Henry's girlfriend yelled at everyone and told us all to leave. She was angry because she had protected Henry, and now she might go to prison as an accomplice. She knew about everything, the abuse and molestation, she knew about all of it. She simply did not care. She loved Henry. She did not want him to leave." 

<p>So then I replied to my sister's first son "Did Henry do anything to you?" And my sister's first son said to me "Recently, my mother took me to swim in a river. Henry was there. I was splashing water on him. And Henry told me "Do that one more time, and watch what will happen next. I'm warning you to stop spashing water on me." And I did not listen to Henry's warning. I splashed him again. And immediately Henry submerged himself underneath the water. For a few seconds I didn't see him. Then, suddenly I felt something pull my shorts and underwear down, and it was Henry, and he started touching my private parts." Then, my mother interrupted him and said "No. That's not what you told me." I yelled at my mother "Shut the f**k up, you're always in denial. He said what he said." So basically, my sister's first son had told his parents "Henry pulled my pants down..." Then everyone began interrogating him as if he was in trouble, so my sister's first son changed his story and said "Henry pulled my pants down... but it was a funny prank he played on me." So then I asked him "If you knew that Henry was bad, why were you excited to visit his house on Thanksgiving." He replied "I'm very extroverted, I just wanted to laugh and play games with the other children."</p>

<p>So then my sister installed a security system because she is paranoid that Henry is going to seek revenge. My sister and her boyfriend reported Henry and his girlfriend to the police and social services. And then my aunt told me "Henry's girlfriend has a history of abusive relationships. All three of her children are from different fathers. And she protected all of them. At one point, she lived in a public housing for domestic violence survivors. She lived there with her boyfriend who was abusing her. She went against their terms, by using her public housing to house her abuser. She is on all types of fraud and welfare programs. Recently, her mother was jay walking when a car hit her, now they are trying to sue the hospital for malpractice."</p>
