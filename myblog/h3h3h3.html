<h1>Ethan flashed his d*ck to a child</h1>
<video controls preload="none"><source src="videos/sph.webm"></video>
<p>Source: <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/LostH3H3Videos/My+Penis.mp4">1</a>, <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210720145240/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7VmW1yD6Dg">2</a></p>

<p>"I flashed my d*ck to a child who was disappointed with my size," what Ethan is describing here is called SPH, also known as Small Penis Humiliation fetish. People with SPH get turned on when you say things like "Your penis is so tiny, ugly, and foul smelling. You don't deserve love."</p>

<h1>Ethan's bestfriend raped a child</h1>
<p>This story is so horrific, it requires a trigger warning, the story is told by Ethan's bestfriend Bobby Lee.</p>
<p><audio controls><source src="https://archive.org/download/DVDASA/DVDASA%20Megapack/Saga%201/DVDASA%20Episode%20071%20-%20The%20Conclusion%20of%20the%20Armenian%20Virgin%20Trilogy%20ft.%20Bobby%20Lee.mp3#t=8435"></audio></p>
<p>Summary: Bobby Lee said "When I was 22 years old, I had sex with a 12 year old prostitute located in Tijuana Mexico; it was awesome, she looked like Natalie Portman from the movie Leon the Professional." Leon the Professional (1994) is a popular movie about a 46 year old man, and a 12 year old girl, who both fall in love with each other, but due to societal norms, they are not allowed to love each other, it's supposedly a tragic love story. I swear to fucking God, google it. The director Luc Besson had sex with a 12 year old girl, in real life, named Ma√Øwenn. He never went to prison for it. They gave him a Best Fantasy Film award.</p>

<h1>Everyone is a pedophile<br>when you're on the H3 Podcast</h1>
<p>Stay tuned for another episode of H3H3 Pedo Hunters featuring the host Ethan Klein who is definitely not a pedophile. Sad trombone music.</p>
<video controls preload="none"><source src="videos/ethan.webm"></video>

<p>It wasn't always like this. It all started in 2017 when Ethan started drinking depression pills, then out of nowhere, he started rambling on like a maniac. He says the government and church is controlled by pedophiles. All republicans are pedophiles. Ethan tweeted this below, he says when you reach 10 million subscribers, you automatically turn into a pedophile. Ethan can spot a pedophile from a mile away.</p>

<p>Did you guys watch that last video?!?! Ethan said "Pretends it's a kid." Pretend what's a kid? Is it just me, or did Ethan pretend to lick a baby's asshole? WTF.</p>

<h1>Here is the video that got Ethan banned for sexual harassment!</h1>
<p>The same way Ethan believes grown men should not watch kpop, Ethan also believes grown men should not play minecraft. That explains why Ethan created this video portraying minecraft players as sexual deviants, aka he is calling them pedophiles.</p>

<p><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3%20opus\kpop.webm"></audio></p>

<p>Also, Ethan says if you watch anime, that means you are a pedophile. Ethan always uses sneaky tactics to call someone a pedophile. He literally set Hasan up like "You said it, not me, I just asked a question."</p>

<h1>Sexual Harassment</h1>
<p>Ethan got banned because he had non-consensual sex with a red puppet <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://poptopic.com.au/news/ethan-klein-simulates-sexual-violence-against-keemstar-in-new-video/">1</a>, and the red puppet is based on a real adult man named Daniel Keem. Whenever Ethan hates you, he makes a doll of you and has sex with it on camera to make you feel worthless and weak. Imagine if Ethan owned a doll of a woman like Candace Owens, and Ethan raped it for a "funny video."</p>

<h1>The Fine Brothers</h1>
<p>Ethan was extremely happy when he found out Benny & Rafi are pedophiles. Ethan said "I have to tone it down." And suddenly Ethan frowned and PRETENDED to act disgusted. But deep down Ethan wasn't disgusted at all, he was extremely happy.</p>
<video controls preload="none"><source src="videos/puppet2.webm"></video>

<h1>Jeff Dunham</h1>
<p>Why was Ethan so happy? Because, many years ago, Ethan owned his very own pedophile puppet! So when Ethan saw Benny & Rafi with their pedophile puppets. Suddenly, Ethan felt like he found his team mates.</p>

<h1>Who are Benny & Rafi?</h1>
<p>Benny & Rafi are the ones who created Kids React. This is a screenshot from Kids React (Oct 16, 2010). Benny & Raffi created the pedophile puppet on June 19, 2010 <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/HeyItsMilly/about">1</a>.</p>

<p>Her name is Lia Marie Johnson. Lia was a victim of child grooming and human trafficking. Here is the article, and disturbing videos. The video shows Lia aged 23 was in a romantic relationship with a 60+ year old man named Steven Wetherbee.</p>

<p>Lia was born on November 23, 1996. Steven is the exclusive photographer for a Pink Army album released on January 1, 2009. Do the math. The grooming started when Lia was only 11 years old.</p>

<p>A child asked Steven "What is your favorite color?" Steven replied "Pink and black." Coincidentally, the Pink Army singers wear pink and black. Also, Steven goes on ice cream dates with children, he watches them lick.</p>

<h1>Diapers</h1>
<p>Ethan said "James charles wears diapers because he has a child rape fantasy." And it makes you wonder why is there a photo of Ethan wearing a diaper?</p>

<h1>Instagram</h1>
<p>For some unknown reason, Ethan deleted this photo.</p>
<img src="images\ethan.avif">
<p>Ethan described this pose as being "a primal mating display."</p>

<h1>We caught Ethan doing financial crimes AGAIN</h1>
<p>Ethan donated $50,000, took a screenshot of it, and posted the screenshot on twitter. Several hours later, the $50,000 dissapeared from GoFundMe.com.</p>
<p><a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Rae2Bae/status/1530784036083404801">https://twitter.com/Rae2Bae/status/1530784036083404801</a></p>
<p>Ethan said "There was a glitch in the system." So I checked the links. On Ethan's screenshot, it says "Teddy Fresh donated on May 28, 2022." Today, GoFundMe says "Teddy Fresh donated on May 31, 2022 14:10 GMT <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://gateway.gofundme.com/web-gateway/v1/feed/mtdrdc-texas-elementary-school-shooting-victims-fund/donations?limit=10&offset=0&sort=highest">1</a>,<a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/mtdrdc-texas-elementary-school-shooting-victims-fund">2</a>" Ethan said "If you think I'm doing financial crimes, you are being antisemitic." Ethan is a literal psychopath. He uses the holocaust as an excuse so no one can investigate his financial crimes. It's disrespectful to the victims of the holocaust. A black man steals skittles, he gets killed by the police. A white man steals $50,000, they give the white man a job promotion.</p>

<p>If you think Ethan would never do a financial crime. Watch this video.</p>

<p>Summary: Unbox Therapy has 18 million subscribers. In 2015, he said "Subscribe to my youtube channel for a chance to win a free iPhone." He had a truck load of iPhones. But then he got exposed. It turns out all those iPhones are empty boxes he purchased from china (real iphones boxes have a shiny shrink plastic wrap." It wasn't a scam like, "Oh, I opened my mail and realized I got scammed." No. In reality, he never mailed anything, because no one won anything, because literally everything was a lie. You are just sitting at your house thinking "Oh well, I guess I didn't win. Better luck next time." This is the insane level of lies MEN will tell you in pursuit of money. They say women are gold diggers. The truth is MEN are the real gold diggers. MEN will do anything for money. Stop looking at Ethan's skin color, and start looking at his gender. Ethan is a MAN. That tells you everything you need to know about him. Men are always guilty no matter what.</p>
