<h1>Everyone is a pedophile<br>when you're on the H3 Podcast</h1>
<p>Stay tuned for another episode of H3H3 Pedo Hunters featuring the host Ethan Klein who is definitely not a pedophile. Sad trombone music.</p>
<video controls preload="none"><source src="videos/ethan.webm"></video>

<p>It wasn't always like this. It all started in 2017 when Ethan started drinking depression pills, then out of nowhere, he started rambling on like a maniac. He says the government and church is controlled by pedophiles. All republicans are pedophiles. Ethan tweeted this below, he says when you reach 10 million subscribers, you automatically turn into a pedophile. Ethan can spot a pedophile from a mile away.</p>

<p>Did you guys watch that last video?!?! Ethan said "Pretends it's a kid." Pretend what's a kid? Is it just me, or did Ethan pretend to lick a baby's asshole? WTF.</p>

<h1>Here is the video that got Ethan banned for sexual harassment!</h1>
<p>The same way Ethan believes grown men should not watch kpop, Ethan also believes grown men should not play minecraft. That explains why Ethan created this video portraying minecraft players as sexual deviants. Ethan believes all grown men who play minecraft or listen to kpop are pedophiles.</p>

<h1>Sexual Harassment</h1>
<p>Ethan got banned because he had non-consensual sex with a red puppet <a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://poptopic.com.au/news/ethan-klein-simulates-sexual-violence-against-keemstar-in-new-video/">1</a>, and the red puppet is based on a real adult man named Daniel Keem. Whenever Ethan hates you, he makes a doll of you and has sex with it on camera to make you feel worthless and weak. Imagine if Ethan owned a doll of a woman like Candace Owens, and Ethan raped it for a "funny video."</p>

<p>On July 4, 2020 Ethan saw this creepy Shane Dawson video. Four months later, suddenly Ethan owns a Daniel Keem puppet. This creepy video literally inspired Ethan.</p>

<h1>The Fine Brothers</h1>
<p>Ethan was extremely happy when he found out Benny & Rafi are pedophiles. Ethan said "I have to tone it down." And suddenly Ethan frowned and PRETENDED to act disgusted. But deep down Ethan wasn't disgusted at all, he was extremely happy.</p>
<video controls preload="none"><source src="videos/puppet2.webm"></video>

<h1>Jeff Dunham</h1>
<p>Why was Ethan so happy? Because, many years ago, Ethan owned his very own pedophile puppet! So when Ethan saw Benny & Rafi with their pedophile puppets. Suddenly, Ethan felt like he found his team mates. Ethan hates Jeff Dunham, because one time Jeff told one bad antisemitic joke. So that's why Ethan turned him into a doll and raped it.</p>

<h1>Who are Benny & Rafi?</h1>
<p>They are the ones who created "Kids React (2010)" Youtube channel. They film kids. And they own a pedophile puppet.</p>

<p>When Patrice Wilson filmed a music video with children, Ethan called Patrice a pedophile. But when two white guys, Benny & Rafi molested a pedophile puppet, suddenly, Ethan is dancing in celebration.</p>

<h1>Ladies and Gentlemen, Ethan Klein.</h1>

<h1>Diapers</h1>
<p>Ethan said "James charles wears diapers because he has a child rape fantasy." And it makes you wonder why is there a photo of Ethan wearing a diaper?</p>

<img src="images\ethan.avif">
<p>Ethan described this pose as being "a primal mating display."</p>

<h1>We caught Ethan doing financial crimes AGAIN</h1>
<p>Ethan donated $50,000, took a screenshot of it, and posted the screenshot on twitter. Several hours later, the $50,000 mysteriously dissapeared from GoFundMe.com.</p>
<p><a aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Rae2Bae/status/1530784036083404801">https://twitter.com/Rae2Bae/status/1530784036083404801</a></p>
<p>Ethan said "There was a glitch in the system." So I checked the links. On Ethan's screenshot, it says "Teddy Fresh donated on May 28, 2022." GoFundMe says "Teddy Fresh donated on June 1, 2022." Ethan said "If you think I'm doing financial crimes, you are being antisemitic." Ethan is a literal psychopath. He uses the holocaust as an excuse so no one can investigate his financial crimes.</p>

<p>If you think Ethan would never do a financial crime. Watch this video.</p>

<p>Summary: Unbox Therapy has 18 million subscribers. In 2015, he said "Subscribe to my youtube channel for a chance to win a free iPhone." He had a truck load of iPhones. But then he got exposed. It turns out all those iPhones are empty boxes he purchased from china. It wasn't a scam like, "Oh, I opened my mail and realized I got scammed." No. In reality, he never mailed anything, because no one won anything, because literally everything was a lie. You are just sitting at your house thinking "Oh well, I guess I didn't win. Better luck next time." This is the level of lies men will tell in pursuit of money.</p>
