<h1>Of all the things Ethan has said on his podcast, this one is by far the worst.</h1>
<p>I feel so sick to my stomach. I can't believe this is allowed on YouTube of all places. Ethan told Andrew Tate "I bet your mommy molested you, that's why you turned into a little gay sissy faggot, that's why you need therapy, that's why you suffer from a mental disorder, because you are a gay pedophile faggot."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\evil.webm"></audio></span></p>

<p>And here Ethan told Myron Gaines "You have mommy issues. I bet your mommy made you wear skirts and tucked your dick like a tranny. Kill yourself faggot."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\evil2.webm"></audio></span></p>

<p>Here is a news article about a transgender kid who did a mass shooting because his classmates told him everyday "Did your daddy penetrate you? Is that why you're a faggot? You look like a future mass shooter. I'm so scared. How many cuts are on your wrists?"<img src="images\reuters.avif"></</p>

<p>And Here Ethan said "Republican Ryan Kavanaugh is a dickless transvestite."<br><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/T5uYYBnwdH0?t=4121">https://youtu.be/T5uYYBnwdH0?t=4121</a></span></p>

<p>And then Ethan goes on Twitter and says "I support LGBTQ." Ethan is gaslighting the entire world, and nobody seems to care, they just keep giving him more and more job promotions.</p>

<h1>Ethan wishes death to all anti-vaxers</h1>
<p><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\antivax.webm"></audio></span><br>And here Ethan said "I hope wendy williams dies from COVID-19, because she is a stupid anti-vaxer."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\evil3.webm"></audio></span></p>
<p class="two">Ethan said "I'm glad Herman Cain died, because he was a stupid anti-vaxer.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\herman.webm"></audio></span></p>

<p>Ethan got canceled for saying the N word. So Ethan replied "I'm only human, I made some mistakes in the past. But I believe it is never too late to change for the better. I donated $10,000 to prove I learned from my mistakes, I'm not racist anymore." The reason Ethan wants to kill antivaxers is because antivaxers are antisemitic. So if you are racist against blacks, Ethan says "It's never too late to change for the better." But if you are antisemitic, Ethan says "Death to all of them!"<br><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\fakeapology.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Ethan Says All Sluts Have Loose Vaginas</h1>
<p><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\loose.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\loose2.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\loose3.webm"></audio></span><br>Ethan says Mike Majlak is pathetic for dating the pornstar Lana Rhoades. Ethan says all sluts, milfs, and pornstars have loose vaginas, and only a cuck would dare to fuck a loose vagina like Lana Rhoades. Hila got outraged. Also, Ethan said "Gay men have loose assholes <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/VWgVZRN7xLQ?t=312">1</a>."</span></p>

<h1>The End of Comedians</h1>
<p>Comedy needs government reform. Would you say BlackFace has comedic value? I believe comedy is glorified bullying. Look at 4chan.org, their form of comedy is "Let's kill all n*ggers and jews hahaha." I believe we need to punish people who make inappropriate jokes. Starting with Ethan Klein. His form of comedy is using the n word, doing blackface, and slut shaming. From now on, you need consent from the person being made fun of, or else you can't call yourself a comedian, then you're just a bully. The comedy consent law should only apply if you are in the entertainment business, and there should be a database like "Jada Pinkett consents to being made of by everyone, except Chris Rock, and noone is allowed to make fun of her bald hair." If you're not on the database, you can't be made fun of. Regulation of comedy is not a regression of society. Comedy adds nothing of value to any meaningful intelligent conversation. Comedy is leisure time for idiots. Look at Jack Ass, people laugh because men are getting kicked in the balls. We should strive for a world where comedians do not exist anymore. Sadly, the world is not ready to cancel comedy just yet.</p>

<h1>Ethan's true opinions on #BLM</h1>
<p>Ethan said "If you think I am racist, kill yourself in minecraft."</p>
<img src="images\degrasse2.webp"></p>

<h1>Ethan is a fake friend</h1>
<p>Bobby Lee told Ethan Klein "I have an open relationship with my wife Khalyla. When my fans found out, they said I was a cuck. I get death threats everyday from people calling me a cuck. The cyber bullying ruined my mental health, so I started seeing a therapist." Ethan replied "Those cyber bullies are not real men, they are pussies, they sound deeply insecure of their masculinity."</p>

<p>And here is Ethan Klein saying "Ryan Kavanugh is a cuck!"<br><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/2Pbu55cclU4?t=9980">https://youtu.be/2Pbu55cclU4?t=9980</a></span></p>

<h1>Ethan Hates Black Beauty Products</h1>
<p class="four">Everytime you go to Walmart, the black beauty products are always locked up because of racist white men like Ethan Klein. This video shows, Ethan hates Tyra Banks simply because Tyra loves vaseline.<br><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/yPkOYgLgGBk">https://youtu.be/yPkOYgLgGBk</a></span></p>

<p>Lotions such as vaseline are an essential part of black culture because dry skin appears white and flakey on dark skin tones. Bill Burr, who is currently married to a black woman, Bill Burr once said "As a white person, if you don't know about lotion, it means you're racist, like you don't have any black friends to tell you about lotion <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/RiH-_ZUILk0">1</a></span>." Black women are known for doing the "slugging" technique where vaseline is applied liberally to the face. Hating vaseline is like hating black culture.<img src="images\slugging.avif"></p>

<h1>Ethan spent decades hating palestine. But when Gal Gadot was cancelled for hating palestine, suddenly Ethan turned into a "lover of palestine."</h1>
<p class="two"><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\borders.webm"></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\innovative.webm"></span><br>Based on episode "H3 Podcast #38 - Hila Klein," Ethan and Hila ran away from Israel to get away from the evil palestinian terrorists. Ethan Klein said it is "super ignorant" to believe palestinians and israelis could live peacefully without borders. Hila Klein replied "When I grew up, I couldn't even ride a bus, because I was too afraid of being blown up by terrorists, and the Gaza wall did help." Ethan described Israel's military as "innovative." During episode #9, Ethan explained his political philosophy on immigration and refugees as "When you save one life, you save the whole world <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/IHL6HazIfQ0?t=2502">2</a>."</span> In other words, Ethan wants open borders in the United States, but closed borders in Israel.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\refugees.webm"></span></p>

<p>Hila Klein says the United States should be strict against white supremacy exactly like Israel is strict against palestine. When Hila Klein said "But there is nothing happening here," she means the United States is doing nothing to stop white supremacy.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\gadot.webm"></audio></span><br></p>

<p class="two">On May 12, 2021 Gal Gadot was canceled on twitter for criticizing palestine. On May 15, 2021 suddenly Ethan tweeted his own support for palestine <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1393699395586052098">1</a>.</span> Ethan Klein and Hila Klein frequently change their opinions to avoid being canceled. Ethan Klein described Israel's military as "innovative," but he also described the United State's military as "corruption."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\corruption.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Ethan owns multiple mansions, and armed security guards to protect himself from "White Supremacy."</h1>
<p class="two">Here is proof. Dirt.com says "The Kleins' $9 million property is located within a 24/7 guard-gated community, a lavish manor in Bel Air <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dirt.com/entertainers/influencers/ethan-klein-house-bel-air-1203300328/">1</a></span>."

Dirt.com also says "besides their new $9 million mansion, records reveal the Kleins still own a $2.3 million Encino house, and another $780,000 Woodland Hills house.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\mansion.webm"></audio></span><br>Ethan wants to defund the police, but yet he pays a private police to protect himself.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\defund.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>For Decades Ethan supported socialism. But when Trump supporters tried to cancel Ethan for "Donation Shaming Jeff Bezos." Suddenly Ethan turned into a lover of capitalism.</h1>
<p class="two"><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\donation2.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\socialist.webm"></audio></span><br>A real honest true socialist would have said "Yeah, I donation shamed Jeff Bezos. I don't give a f*ck. My philosophy is socialism." But Ethan didn't say that. Instead Ethan said "I would never donation anyone. I support financial freedom." Even though the exact definition of socialism is to donation shame billionaires. This shows Ethan will do and say whatever it takes to avoid being cancelled, he will even support Donald Trump to appease a hate mob. Here is Ethan donation shaming Pauly Shore. Pauly Shore donated $5 to Ethan's livestream, and Ethan immediately searched up Pauly Shore's net worth on google.com, and Ethan commanded Pauly Shore to donate more. Ethan's net worth was $20 million. Pauly Shore's was $30 million. If you are $1 richer than Ethan, that means you owe Ethan money.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\shore1.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\shore2.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Hate Speech (1984)</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan says the word "female" is hate speech. Consequently, Ethan banned the word "female" from his whole entire workplace. On episode "H3TV #11" Ethan's employee AB Ayad got in trouble for accidentally uttering the word female. According to Ethan, the politically correct word for "female" is "women."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\female4.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\female2.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\female3.webm"></audio></span><br>1.5 months later, and Ethan is outraged because youtube does not allow him to utter the word "cunt." Also, Ethan tweeted "Our government is run by cunts <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1342219282625699840">1</a>."</span> And Ethan constantly uses the words "bitch, pussy, and cunt" to describe people. In Ethan's mind, you are not allowed to call women cunts, you are only allowed to call straight white men cunts, because there is no history of oppression against straight white men <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1470971707338878982">2</a>.</span>Also, Ethan said "Kim Kardashian is an obnoxious bitch <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/_VovzI50yC4?t=13135">1</a>."</span> And Hila got outraged.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\cword.webm"></audio></span></p>

There are news articles about it. And Ethan never denied it. Ethan only assured everyone that no crimes were committed. Almir Listo and Ethan are not close friends. There is only one explanation for this. Almir Listo thought to himself "I'm white. Ethan  Klein is white. I believe in socialism. Ethan believes in socialism. I am going to donate $1 million to Ethan simply because I love white people who believe in socialism just like me."</p>

<h1>Vegans tried to cancel Ethan for purchasing Shredder. Suddenly, Ethan "rescued" Alfredo.</h1>
<p class="two">The only reason Ethan rescued Alfredo is because there was a hate mob. And Ethan did not rescue just any random dog. He rescued a purebred maltese <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B2M9DHrgtcz/?utm_source=ig_embed">1</a>,</span> his favorite breed. Let me explain why this is so fucked up. So basically, Kill Shelters will take any dog no matter what. But No Kill Shelter reserve the right to deny any dog. No Kill Shelters look at your dog and if your dog is ugly, they will say to your face "I'm sorry, our facility is full at this moment. We're not accepting dogs right now." No one wants to adopt ugly old mutt dogs with missing limbs, they only want to adopt cute perfect purebred puppies. So all the ugly dogs never get adopted or they end up in Kill Shelters because of racist people like Ethan Klein.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\breed.webm"></audio></span><br>Listen to this story, and find out what happens to cute animals once they turn ugly.

<h1>Adpocalypse</h1>
<p class="two">This is a conspiracy theory about Ethan Klein. Here are my primary sources <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/addressing-creator-feedback-and-update/">1</a>,</span><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.google/intl/en-in/products/platforms/an-update-to-our-harassment-policy/">2</a>.</span> First, here are the facts. In 2019, the CEO of Youtube interviewed 8 youtubers, including Ethan Klein. Susan Wojcicki asked those 8 youtubers "How can I improve youtube?" As a direct result of those meetings, on December 2019, Matt Halprin, who is the vice president of youtube, updated Youtube's Hate Speech policies. Youtube's new and improved Hate Speech policies caused an adpocolypse. An adpocolypse is when millions of videos are demonetized for so called "Hate Speech." Which is why in order to earn a living, many youtubers resort to selling merchandise. There is a list of almost 3,000 demonetized words. For example, if you use the word "allegation," there is a high chance your video will be demonetized <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.insider.com/youtubers-identify-title-words-that-get-videos-demonetized-experiment-2019-10">1</a></span>. That is the truth. But now here is the conspiracy theory part: When Susan Wojcicki asked "How can I improve Youtube?" I believe Ethan is the only one who replied "I want youtube to be stricter on hate speech." I believe this conspiracy theory because out of all those 8 youtubers Susan Wojcicki interviewed, Ethan is the only one who is passionate about fighting hate speech. Here are the names of the 8 youtubers Susan Wojcicki interviewed. Korea Grandma, Prajakta Koli, Shane Dawson, James Charles, Collins and Devan Key, Ethan and Hila Klein, and Safiya Nygaard. If you read the articles, there is evidence the other youtubers did not ask to fight hate speech, instead they said "I want youtube to stop demonetizing me for copyrighted music when I only play less than 10 second clips of a song." Ethan is not your average celebrity youtuber. What makes Ethan special, is Ethan has the power to directly change our public policies.</p>

<h1>Jeff Wittek wants to kill Ethan.</h1>

<p>Jeff Wittek went to prison for minor drug charges, and David Dobrik constantly made jokes saying "Jeff Wittek is in the italian mafia <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr7Um5Z0N38">1</a></span>." Jeff Wittek faces constant discrimination due to having a criminal record, and those italian mafia jokes made it worse. Jeff Wittek doesn't want to be known as "the italian criminal," he just wants to be seen as a normal person, he already served his prison time. Everyday Jeff Wittek lives in constant fear of being sent back to prison, especially because all his friends are youtube pranksters which attracts attention from the police. Prison is traumatizing, that's why Jeff Wittek hates those italian mafia jokes.<br><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/J19qOeSWn6A?t=1332">https://youtu.be/J19qOeSWn6A?t=1332</a></span></p>

<p>So finally, Ethan Klein made hours long jokes like "Jeff Wittek is human trafficker, hey fuhgeddaboudit." Jeff Wittek had a mental breakdown and said "I'm going to kill Ethan Klein, I know where he lives <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/0iERMe-x48s?t=504">1</a>, I drove by his house the other day and I stalked his whole family."</span> Ethan replied "If you can't take my italian jokes, then you shouldn't be a youtuber. Stop acting like a beta male. If you have a problem, just sue me. Pussy, you don't have to threaten to kill me or my family. Just sue me bitch." And that's the thing. Ethan Klein was born rich, never had any issues in life, he would just sue everyone. But Jeff Wittek grew up poor, never had lawyers, so early on Jeff learned the only way to solve problems is through violence and intimidation. Ethan hates bullies, but is the biggest bully of them all. And it's just racist everytime Ethan does an italian mobster impersonation, imagine if I did a greedy jew impersonation.<br><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/HN3qR2H4jGY"></a></span></p>

<h1>Patrice Wilson wants to kill Ethan.</h1>
<p>Ethan said "Patrice Wilson is a filthy n*gger pedophile who wants to rape innocent white children. I can't wait for the police to kill Patrice Wilson." The only evidence Ethan had is Patrice Wilson is a black man who built a career around children. Mr. Rodgers built a career around children too, but you don't see Ethan accusing Mr. Rodgers of being a pedo, in fact Ethan is a big fan of Mr. Rodgers, because Mr. Rodgers has white privilege.</p>

<p>Due to all the false pedophile allegations Ethan made, suddenly Patrice Wilson's career ended. Patrice fell into a very deep, dark, and suicidal depression. For one year straight, Patrice lived in complete isolation. All Patrice did was stay home alone crying in his bathroom. In order to cope and deconstruct the trauma, Patrice Wilson created a video artwork project titled "666 H3H3." Ethan reacted to Patrice's artwork and said "What a f*cking loser and creep. After all these years, and Patrice Wilson still gives me pedo vibes. Pathetic." So the main reason Ethan believes Patrice Wilson is being creepy is because Patrice suffers from a psychological symptom called Stilted Speech, which means Patrice talks very slow. I edited this audio below (removal of silence), because Patrice talks too slow.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\patrice.webm"></audio></span><br>Source: <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/QYVP-mMVRVg">1</a></span></p>

<p>The reason Patrice talks too slow is the same reason Willy Wonka said "Good morning starshine, the Earth says hello." After Willy Wonka's secret formulas were stolen, Willy Wonka fell into a very deep, dark, and suicidal depression. Willy Wonka spent 15 years in complete isolation, and when Willy Wonka finally re-emerged from his man-cave, he nearly forgot how to speak English, that's why he was reading from a script. He heard in a song once "Good morning starshine, the earth says hello" and thought "That must be how humans talk now days." So basically Ethan bullied Patrice Wilson so hard that Patrice even forgot how to speak english, and now that Patrice can't speak english, Ethan bullies him even more.</p>

<p>I will explain the symbolism behind Patrice Wilson's artwork: The cemetary represents the internet death threats Patrice received. The bathroom shower head represents all the days he cried. The 666 represents the satan inside him that wanted to kill Ethan Klein. According to psychologists, the "five stages of grief" includes anger. The long railroad represents when he reaches the light at the end of the railroad he is going to kill himself. Railroads have a long history of being used as a symbol for suicide. For example, in the song "The biggest lie" by Elliott Smith, the lyrics are "I'm waiting for the train, to make everybody late." It means Elliott Smith is waiting for the train, so he can jump in front of it and die, and once he is dead, janitors will clean the blood on the railroad tracks, causing train delays, and whoever was waiting for the train will now be late to work. The song is called "The biggest lie" because Elliott actually told the truth about his suicidal thoughts, but he only says it's a lie because he doesn't want people to feel sorry. The lyrics "You turned white like a saint" Elliott is imagining how his family would react to his suicide; their faces turned white with disbelief.</p>
