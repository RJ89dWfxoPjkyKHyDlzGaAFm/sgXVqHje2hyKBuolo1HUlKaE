<h1>Logical Fallacy (Pointing the Finger)</h1>
<p>In order to understand Ethan Klein, you should know the logical fallacy called "Pointing the Finger." Just because you call out another person's evil actions, it does not make your own evil actions any less evil. For example, a racist person might say "I'm not racist, look at Joe Rogan, he said the N word, he's racist, I call out racism when I see it, I'm not racist." Another example, on Law & Order SVU S11E2, Erik Weber is the leader of a vigilante group who catch pedophiles. It turns out Erik Weber was the biggest pedo of them all. That's what Ethan Klein is. Ethan is the biggest supporter of Black Lives Matter, but in reality Ethan is the most racist of them all.<img src="images\degrasse2.webp"></p>

<h1>Ethan Hates Wendy Williams</h1>
<p>Wendy Williams is a famous anti-vaxer. Ethan said "I hope Wendy Williams dies from COVID-19 for being a stupid anti-vaxer." Also, Ethan said "Wendy Williams is so ugly, it looks like she has a gallon of botox injected on her face." Ethan regularly body shames women. And also, Wendy Williams ate a slim jim live on television. And Ethan said "OMG I can't believe the studio producers are allowing Wendy Williams to be so unprofessional during live television." That's literally what racist people say when they discriminate against blacks "Black people are so unprofessional, unfit for the workplace."<br><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/wIgqznkfiE8">https://youtu.be/wIgqznkfiE8</a></span><br></p>

<h1>Ethan Hates Black Beauty Products</h1>
<p>Everytime you go to Walmart, the black beauty products are always locked up because of racist white men like Ethan Klein. This video shows, Ethan hates Tyra Banks simply because Tyra loves vaseline.<br><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/yPkOYgLgGBk">https://youtu.be/yPkOYgLgGBk</a></span><br>Lotions like vaseline are an essential part of black culture because dry skin appears visibly white and flakey on dark skin tones. It's like that joke told by Bill Burr "As a white person, if you don't know about lotion, it means you're racist, like you don't have any black friends to tell you about lotion <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/RiH-_ZUILk0">1</a></span>." Black women are known for doing the "slugging" technique where vaseline is applied liberally to the face. Hating vaseline is like hating black culture.<img src="images\slugging.avif">

<p>Black women are always conforming to European beauty standards, and Ethan thinks it's hilarious. Literally, black women bleach their skin with toxic chemicals like hydroquinone just to appear whiter. Literally, search up on Youtube "Racist Doll Test <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/tkpUyB2xgTM?t=67">1</a></span>." Psychologists gave blacks girls a black doll and a white doll and asked them "which doll is beautiful?" and all the black girls said "The white doll is beautiful. The black doll is ugly. I want to be more like a white barbie." Blacks are discriminated in employment for having "unprofessional hair," African hair is scientifically special, so that's why California has "CROWN Act" to protect blacks from being discriminated for their hair. Shut the fuck up Ethan. Stop telling black women what they should or should not wear on their skin. Ethan said "the Tyra Banks show is straight bananas." Literally called her a monkey. Pay attention to Ethan's vocabulary, and you will notice whenever Ethan talks about black culture or racism, he starts using words like "bananas and gorillas". For example, Ethan told a white supremacist "You are a fucking ape-gorilla <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/lXyGJVWafH8?t=6273">1</a></span>!" The most offensive word in Ethan's immediate vocabulary is "ape-gorilla." It's like Ethan is so desperate to say the N word. That's why Ethan loves using the word "cracker."</p>

<h1>Ethan Hates Travis Scott</h1>
<p>Several people died in a Travis Scott concert. That's why Ethan hates Travis. Ethan says "It's not normal to die in concerts." Let me explain why Ethan is being racist. Basically, Travis Scott grew up in a ghetto neighborhood. In the ghetto, it normal for people to die, you become desensitized to it. The fact Ethan says "It's not normal to die in concerts" that demonstrates how much white privilege Ethan has, he has always lived in a gated white neighborhood. Many psychologists say living in the ghetto is the equivalent of living with PTSD, because every day you are exposed to violence and death. I wish I could tell you the stories I've seen in the ghettos, probably the worse is a man pulled a knife on me.</p>

<h1>Ethan Hates Will Smith</h1>
<p>Ethan says "If you believe Will Smith did nothing wrong, please unsubscribe from my podcast and kill yourself in minecraft <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/yH6GnXkHZOA?t=3028">1</a></span>." Meanwhile, Alec Baldwin literally killed someone, and Ethan says "Alex Baldwin did nothing wrong."<br><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://fb.watch/c3nKpKEvYw/">https://fb.watch/c3nKpKEvYw/</a></span></p>

<p>Here is a video of Ethan reacting to a white mass shooter, and Ethan says "Mass shooters is a gun control and mental health issue." But yet Will Smith slapped Chris Rock, and suddenly Ethan wants to lynch Will Smith.<br><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/baC2qEuel6Y">https://youtu.be/baC2qEuel6Y</a></span></p>

<p>As a child, Will Smith was physically abused by his father. Corporal punishment is prevalent among black households because white slave owners whipped black slaves, so that's why black parents today whip their black children. In Rodney King's book titled "The Riot Within," it's revealed Rodney King's violent tendencies was caused by generational trauma of slavery and racism. #ProtectBlackWomen was trending on twitter where thousands of black women came to defend Will Smith. The hashtag was quickly banned from Twitter, because of Twitter's rule "We prohibit the glorification of violence." If you defend Will Smith, you are glorifying violence.<br><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/qOTe0_Z0vlc">https://youtu.be/qOTe0_Z0vlc</a></span><br>

<p>When a person has a mental breakdown, it's not the quality of the disrespect, it's the quantity. Will Smith was not angry at the present joke, he was angry at all the years of abuse that came before. Imagine every day scrolling through your instagram messages and reading "Will Smith is a faggot, simp, and cuck, every time he kisses his wife, he is drinking another man's semen. Jada Pinkett is a gold digger who deserves to be killed and raped, her pussy looks like roast beef, very loose like a plastic bag." After reading hateful messages, you develop PTSD, you're paranoid, you dissociate, and you have a split personality. In an interview with Esquire.com, Will Smith said "When I was fifteen my girlfriend cheated on me, and I decided that if I was number one, no woman would ever cheat on me ever again <a target="_blank" href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/interviews/a9938/will-smith-interview-0315/">1</a>."</span> Cheating is a sensitive topic for Will Smith. Will Smith worked hard to be rich and famous because deep down all ever he wanted was to find true love. Will Smith believed that if he behaved like a high quality man, it would lead to finding a high quality woman.</p>

<h1>Ethan Says All Sluts Have Loose Vaginas</h1>
<p><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\loose.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\loose2.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\loose3.webm"></audio></span><br>Ethan says Mike Majlak is pathetic for dating the pornstar Lana Rhoades. Ethan says all sluts, milfs, and pornstars have loose vaginas, and only a cuck would dare to fuck a loose vagina like Lana Rhoades. Hila got outraged.</p>

<h1>Ethan Slut Shames</h1>
<p>Ethan says Pete Davidson is a gold digging clout chasing whore who deserves to get killed by Kanye West. When Ethan said "He fucked too close to the sun, and his dick got burned." It means Pete deserves whatever punishment he gets from Kanye West. It's like the joke Bill Burr told "There are plenty of reasons to hit women, like if she's a gold digger <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/rksKvZoUCPQ">1</a>."</span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\pete2.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\pete3.webm"></audio></span></h1>

<h1>Ethan's favorite word is cuck.</h1>
<p>Here is a video where Ethan explains in great detail why Ryan Kavanaugh is a cuck.<br><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/2Pbu55cclU4?t=9980">https://youtu.be/2Pbu55cclU4?t=9980</a></span><br>Ethan's usage of the word cuck is misogynistic. Basically, Ethan believes a man's worth is based on the body count of his sexual conquests. If your wife is a perfect 10/10 virgin, that means you are an Alpha Male. There are two types of alpha males. The first type of Alpha Male has sex with hundreds of women, he is a liar, cheater, womanizer, and sleeps with your wife. The second type of Alpha Male is in a monogamous relationship with one perfect virgin flawless untouched never photographed super tight vagina. Men who marry virgins are called Sigma-Alpha Males. Sigma Males are the most powerful and upperclass men. Beta males hate the alpha males, because alpha males are going to have sex with the beta male's wife. But because Sigma-Alpha Males are in a committed relationship, beta males don't perceive Sigma Males as a threat. That's why Sigma-Males are leaders.</p>

<p>Ethan says "If you are a man, and you use words like Alpha male and Beta male, that means you are acting like a beta male." So Ethan calls all his enemies "beta males" because Ethan thinks his enemies are using the word "beta male" but literally Ethan is the only person on this planet Earth who actually uses the word beta male. Strawman Fallacy.</p>

<h1>Ethan hates the Fresh & Fit Podcast</h1>
<p>The Fresh & Fit is a podcast where african-americans have conversations with white people. That's why Ethan hates them. Because every time blacks and whites agree on topics, the chances of that conversation turning anti-semitic sky rockets. Ethan says "The Fresh and Fit podcast is mysognistic." How is it mysogynistic? The Fresh & Fit podcast literally has dozens of women on there sharing their female perspectives. It's like the quote by Denzel Washington, "How do we end racism? By having conversations. You can't legislate love."<br><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/nwsvpHx-vu0">https://youtu.be/nwsvpHx-vu0</a></span></p>

<h1>Ethan says Fat Women & Women with Plastic Surgery Should Be Banned From Magazines</h1>
<p><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/ynTkPCW2P_I">https://youtu.be/ynTkPCW2P_I</a></span><br>
Ethan says fatness is laziness, and laziness should not be on magazines. Ethan praises anorexic women, he says it takes tremendous willpower to maintain a perfect skinny body. Also, Ethan says women with plastic surgery should be banned from magazines to protect "mental health."</p> 


<h1>Ethan spent decades hating palestine. But when Gal Gadot was cancelled for hating palestine, suddenly Ethan turned into a "lover of palestine."</h1>
<p class="two"><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\borders.webm"></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\innovative.webm"></span><br>Based on episode "H3 Podcast #38 - Hila Klein," Ethan Klein and Hila Klein ran away from Israel in order to evade persecution from palestinian terrorists. Ethan Klein said it is "super ignorant" to believe palestinians and israelis could live peacefully without borders. Hila Klein replied "When I grew up, I couldn't even ride a bus, because I was too afraid of being blown up by terrorists, and the Gaza wall did help." Ethan Klein described Israel's military as "innovative." During episode #9, Ethan Klein explained his political philosophy on immigration and refugees as "When you save one life, you save the whole world <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/IHL6HazIfQ0?t=2502">2</a>."</span> In other words, Ethan Klein wants open borders in the United States, but closed borders in Israel.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\refugees.webm"></span><br>Here is video from July 2014 when Ethan Klein lived in Israel, and you can hear a real explosion in the background.<video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21625&authkey=%21AIf8E0ZiARkkbh0"></video><br>Video Source: <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/q0rmyQfFyKw">1</a></span></p>

<h1>Ethan justifies killing muslims, because he believes all muslims are anti-semitic.</h1>
<p>Ethan says we need to wage war against white supremacy exactly like the bush administration waged war against muslims. And Ethan says doing nothing about white supremacy is like doing nothing about the 9/11 terror attacks. Ethan loves bombing muslims. Context: Ethan is reacting to Neil Degrasse Tyson's tweet where Neil says viral pandemics & medical errors are a bigger issue than white supremacy.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\alqaeda2.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\islamophobic.webm"></audio></span></p>

<p>Hila Klein says the United States should be strict against white supremacy exactly like Israel is strict against palestine. When Hila Klein said "But there is nothing happening here," she means the United States is doing nothing to stop white supremacy.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\gadot.webm"></audio></span><br></p>

<p class="two">On May 12, 2021 Gal Gadot was canceled on twitter for criticizing palestine. On May 15, 2021 suddenly Ethan Klein tweeted his own support for palestine <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1393699395586052098">1</a>.</span> Ethan Klein and Hila Klein frequently change their opinions to avoid being canceled. Ethan Klein described Israel's military as "innovative," but he also described the United State's military as "corruption."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\corruption.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Ethan owns multiple mansions and armed security guards to protect himself from "White Supremacy."</h1>
<p class="two">Here is proof. Dirt.com says "The Kleins' $9 million property is located within a 24/7 guard-gated community, a lavish manor in Bel Air <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dirt.com/entertainers/influencers/ethan-klein-house-bel-air-1203300328/">1</a></span>."

<h1>Ethan married a foreigner so no one could accuse him of being racist.</h1>
<p class="two">Tokenism is when a white person says "I'm not racist, my friend is black." Here is an audio clip of Ethan doing tokenism. Ethan said "I'm not xenophobic, my wife is a minority."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\token.webm"></audio></span><br>And here is Ethan accusing Steven Crowder and Tucker Carlson of doing tokenism.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\steven.webm"></audio></span><br>Ethan is reacting to a news article describing how Alex Jones was caught watching transgender porn. If Alex Jones is a transphobe who enjoys transgender porn, then Ethan is a white supremacist who married a minority. Ethan has a slave owner fetish.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\alex.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Ethan says racism against blacks is forgivable, but anti-semitism should be punished with the death penalty.</h1>
<p>Ethan wishes death to all antivaxers.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\antivax.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\fakeapology.webm"></audio></span></p>

<p>Ethan spent decades hating black people, but when celebrities were cancelled for saying "All Lives Matter," suddenly Ethan turned into a "lover of black people." In the video "My Experience with the Police," Ethan apologized for his racist past. Ethan said "Sometimes a hypocrite is simply a man in the process of changing. And it is never too late to change for the better." The reason Ethan wants to kill antivaxers is because antivaxers are antisemitic. So if you are racist against blacks, Ethan says "It's never too late to change." But if you are antisemitic, Ethan says "Death to all of them!"</p>

<h1>Ethan donated $10,000 to prove that he isn't racist.</h1>
<p class="two"></p>

<h1>For Decades Ethan supported socialism. But when Trump supporters tried to cancel Ethan for "Donation Shaming Jeff Bezos." Suddenly Ethan turned into a lover of capitalism.</h1>
<p class="two"><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\donation2.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\socialist.webm"></audio></span><br>A real honest true socialist would have said "Yeah, I donation shamed Jeff Bezos. I don't give a f*ck. My philosophy is socialism." But Ethan didn't say that. Instead Ethan said "I would never donation anyone. I support financial freedom." Even though the exact definition of socialism is to donation shame billionaires. This shows Ethan will do and say whatever it takes to avoid being cancelled, he will even support Donald Trump to appease a hate mob. Here is Ethan donation shaming Pauly Shore. Pauly Shore donated $5 to Ethan Klein's livestream, and Ethan immediately searched up Pauly Shore's net worth on google.com, and Ethan commanded Pauly Shore to donate more. Ethan's net worth was $20 million. Pauly Shore's was $30 million. If you are $1 richer than Ethan, that means you owe Ethan money.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\shore1.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\shore2.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Hate Speech (1984)</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan says the word "female" is hate speech. Consequently, Ethan banned the word "female" from his whole entire workplace. On episode "H3TV #11" Ethan's employee AB Ayad got in trouble for accidentally uttering the word female. According to Ethan, the politically correct word for "female" is "women."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\female4.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\female2.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\female3.webm"></audio></span><br>1.5 months later, and Ethan is outraged because youtube does not allow him to utter the word "cunt."

In Ethan's mind, you are not allowed to call women cunts, you are only allowed to call straight white men cunts, because there is no history of oppression against straight white men <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1470971707338878982">2</a>.</span>Also, Ethan said "Kim Kardashian is an obnoxious bitch <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/_VovzI50yC4?t=13135">1</a>."</span> And Hila got outraged.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\cword.webm"></audio></span></p>

There are news articles about it. And Ethan never denied it. Ethan only assured everyone that no crimes were committed. Almir Listo and Ethan are not close friends. There is only one explanation for this. Almir Listo thought to himself "I'm white. Ethan Klein is white. I believe in socialism. Ethan Klein believes in socialism. I am going to donate $1 million to Ethan Klein simply because I love white people who believe in socialism just like me." Literally, Ethan received $1 million for having white skin.</p>

<p class="two">When famous youtubers email youtube for technical support, despite their fame, they still only receive computer generated replies. But not Ethan.

<h1>Even More Racism</h1>
<p class="two">"And The New Host Is..." Ethan Klein celebrated the death of Herman Cain, an innocent black man who died from coronavirus. Ethan was following an internet trend called "The Herman Cain Awards."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\herman.webm"></audio></span><br>Ethan's co-host Hasan Piker explained the psychology behind why it is good to celebrate Herman Cain's death <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/uASzNUFT5Dk?t=4997">1</a>.</span> He says "Conservatives are motivated by hatred." In other words, if you associate antivaxers with dead black people, it encourages racist people to get vaccinated.</p>

<h1>Vegans tried to cancel Ethan for purchasing Shredder. Suddenly, Ethan "rescued" Alfredo.</h1>
<p class="two">The only reason Ethan rescued Alfredo is because there was a hate mob. And Ethan did not rescue just any random dog. He rescued a purebred maltese <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B2M9DHrgtcz/?utm_source=ig_embed">1</a>,</span> his favorite breed. Let me explain why this is so fucked up. So basically, Kill Shelters will take any dog no matter what. But No Kill Shelter reserve the right to deny any dog. No Kill Shelters look at your dog and if your dog is ugly, they will say to your face "I'm sorry, our facility is full at this moment. We're not accepting dogs right now." No one wants to adopt ugly old mutt dogs with missing limbs, they only want to adopt cute perfect purebred puppies. So all the ugly dogs never get adopted or they end up in Kill Shelters because of racist people like Ethan Klein.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\breed.webm"></audio></span><br>Listen to this story, and find out what happens to cute animals once they turn ugly. They end up in the trash.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\sysk.webm"></audio></span><br>This is why you should never trust Ethan Klein. When a white person says "I'm not racist" that means he is racist. Ethan's opinions change based on the stock markets, he will do and say whatever it takes for money, he will even say the N word. In fact, Ethan already said the N word to impress idubbbz, a famous youtuber.</p>

<h1>Bribery</h1>

<h1>Taxes</h1>
<p class="two"><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\mexico.webm"></audio></span><br>Ethan hates mexico because they charged him 15% taxes. Ethan vowed to never visit mexico ever again. He says there is too much taxes, crime, and corruption in mexico. But it's not Ethan's fault. He says it's white people's fault. Ethan's not white, he's jewish. It's definitely not Ethan's fault, a man who travels to mexico just for fun with a $5,000 camera while the whole country of mexico is literally poor. 44% of mexicans live below the poverty line, and Ethan's family is lugging around cameras and high definition televisions.</p>

<h1>Adpocalypse</h1>
<p class="two">This is a conspiracy theory about Ethan Klein. I believe Ethan Klein accidentally created an adpocalypse. Here are my primary sources <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/addressing-creator-feedback-and-update/">1</a>,</span><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.google/intl/en-in/products/platforms/an-update-to-our-harassment-policy/">2</a>.</span> First, here are the facts. Susan Wojcicki is the CEO of Youtube. Matt Halprin is the Vice President of Youtube. In 2019, Susan Wojcicki interviewed 8 youtubers, including Ethan Klein. Susan Wojcicki asked those 8 youtubers "How can I improve youtube?" As a direct result of those meetings, Susan Wojcicki and Matt Halprin updated Youtube's Hate Speech policies on December 2019. Youtube's new and improved Hate Speech policies caused an adpocolypse. An adpocolypse is when millions of videos are demonetized for so called "Hate Speech." Which is why in order to earn a living, many youtubers resort to selling merchandise. There is a list of almost 3,000 "demonetized words." For example, if you use the word "allegation," there is a high chance your video will be demonetized. That is the truth. But now here is the conspiracy theory part: When Susan Wojcicki asked "How can I improve Youtube?" I believe Ethan is the only one who replied "I want youtube to be stricter on hate speech." I believe this conspiracy theory because out of all those 8 youtubers Susan Wojcicki interviewed, Ethan is the only one who is obsessed about fighting hate speech. Here are the names of the 8 youtubers Susan Wojcicki interviewed. Korea Grandma, Prajakta Koli, Shane Dawson, James Charles, Collins and Devan Key, Ethan and Hila Klein, and Safiya Nygaard. And if you read the article, there is evidence the other youtubers did not ask to fight hate speech, instead they said "I want to see more small creators on the trending page. And I want youtube to stop demonetizing me for copyrighted music when I only play less than 10 second clips of a song."</p>

<h1>Jeff Wittek wants to kill Ethan. And it's Ethan's fault</h1>

<p>Jeff Wittek went to prison for minor drug charges, and David Dobrik constantly made jokes saying "Jeff Wittek is in the italian mafia <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr7Um5Z0N38">1</a></span>." Jeff Wittek faces constant discrimination due to having a criminal record, and those italian mafia jokes made it worse. Jeff Wittek doesn't want to be known as "the italian criminal," he just wants to be seen as a normal person, he already served his prison time. Everyday Jeff Wittek lives in constant fear of being sent back to prison, especially because all his friends are youtube pranksters which attracts attention from the police. Prison is traumatizing, that's why Jeff Wittek hates those italian mafia jokes.<br><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/J19qOeSWn6A?t=1332">https://youtu.be/J19qOeSWn6A?t=1332</a></span></p>

<p>So finally, Ethan Klein made hours long jokes calling Jeff Wittek an "Italian mobster." Jeff Wittek had a mental breakdown and said "I'm going to kill Ethan Klein, I know where he lives <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/0iERMe-x48s?t=504">1</a>."</span> Ethan replied "If you can't take my italian jokes, then you shouldn't be a youtuber. Stop acting like a beta male. If you have a problem, just sue me bitch. You don't have to threaten to kill me or my family. Just sue me bitch." And that's the thing. Ethan Klein was born rich, never had any issues in life, he would just sue everyone. But Jeff Wittek grew up poor, never had lawyers, so early on Jeff learned the only way to solve problems is through violence and intimidation. Ethan hates bullies, but is the biggest bully of them all. And it's just racist everytime Ethan does an italian mobster impersonation, imagine if I did a greedy jew impersonation.<br><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/HN3qR2H4jGY"></a></span></p>

<h1>Patrice Wilson wants to kill Ethan. It's Ethan's fault.</h1>
<p>Basically Ethan said "Patrice Wilson is a filthy n*gger pedophile who wants to rape innocent white children. I hope the police kills Patrice Wilson." The only evidence Ethan had is Patrice Wilson is a black man who built a career around children. Mr. Rodgers built a career around children too, but you don't see Ethan accusing Mr. Rodgers of being a pedo, in fact Ethan is a big fan of Mr. Rodgers, because Mr. Rodgers is white.<br><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/QbET_heKmqk">https://youtu.be/QbET_heKmqk</a></span></p>

<p>Due to all the false pedophile allegations that Ethan made, Patrice Wilson was fired from his job, and Patrice fell into a very deep, dark, and suicidal depression. For one year straight, Patrice lived in complete isolation, all Patrice did was stay home alone crying in his bed. In order to cope and deconstruct his trauma, Patrice Wilson created a video artwork project titled "666 H3H3." Ethan reacted to Patrice's artwork and said "What a f*cking loser and creep. After all these years, and Patrice Wilson still gives me pedo vibes. Pathetic." So the main reason Ethan believes Patrice Wilson is being creepy is because Patrice suffers from a psychological symptom called Stilted Speech, which means Patrice talks very slow.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\patrice.webm"></audio></span><br>Source: <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/QYVP-mMVRVg">1</a></span></p>

<p>The reason Patrice talks very slow is the same reason Willy Wonka said "Good morning starshine, the Earth says hello." After Willy Wonka's secret formulas were stolen, Willy Wonka fell into a very deep, dark, and suicidal depression. Willy Wonka spent 15 years in complete isolation, and when Willy Wonka finally re-emerged from his man-cave, he nearly forgot how to speak English, that's why he was reading from a script. He heard in a song once "Good morning starshine, the earth says hello" and thought "That must be how humans talk now days." So basically Ethan bullied Patrice Wilson so hard that Patrice even forgot how to speak english, and now that Patrice can't speak english, Ethan bullies him even more.</p>

<p>I will explain the symbolism behind Patrice Wilson's artwork: The cemetary represents the internet death threats Patrice received. The bathroom shower head represents all the days he cried. The 666 represents the satan inside him that wanted to kill Ethan Klein. According to psychologists, the "five stages of grief" includes anger. The long railroad represents when he reaches the light at the end of the railroad he is going to kill himself. Railroads have a long history of being used as a symbol for suicide. For example, in the song "The biggest lie" by Elliott Smith, the lyrics are "I'm waiting for the train, to make everybody late." It means Elliott Smith is waiting for the train, so he can jump in front of it and die, and once he is dead, janitors will clean the blood on the railroad tracks, causing train delays, and whoever was waiting for the train will now be late to work. The song is called "The biggest lie" because Elliott actually told the truth about his suicidal thoughts, but he only says it's a lie because he doesn't want people to feel sorry. The lyrics "You turned white like a saint" Elliott is imagining how his family would react to his suicide; their faces turned white with disbelief.</p>

<h1>Ryan Kavanaugh wants to kill Ethan. It's Ethan's fault.</h1>
<p>Ethan Klein created DoesRyanKavanaughLookLikeHarveyWeinstein.com, insinuating that Ryan Kavanaugh might be a pedophile. Ethan is literally bullying Ryan Kavanaugh, so that's why Ryan Kavanaugh has been obsessively stalking and harassing Ethan with lawsuits and death threats. That makes a grand total of 3 people who want Ethan dead, Patrice Wilson, Jeff Wittek, and Ryan Kavanaugh. But remember it's not Ethan's fault. Ethan's an innocent victim who never did anything wrong.</p>

<h1>Ethan thinks everyone is a pedophile</h1>
<P>Here is a list of innocent people ethan has wrongfully accused them of being pedophiles: Vanilla Ice, The Quartering, Michello 2.0, TheRealJBecker2, Fleur, Nelk Boys, Woosh From Mars, Keemstar, David Dobrik, Socrates, and so much more. For legal reasons, Ethan stopped calling people "pedo" and now he calls them "predatory."</p>
