<h1>Palestine vs Israel</h1>
<p class="two"><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\borders.webm"></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\innovative.webm"></span><br>Based on episode "H3 Podcast #38 - Hila Klein," Ethan Klein and Hila Klein ran away from Israel in order to evade persecution from palestinian terrorists. Ethan Klein said it is "super ignorant" to believe palestinians and israelis could live peacefully without borders. Hila Klein replied "When I grew up, I couldn't even ride a bus, because I was too afraid of being blown up by terrorists, and the Gaza wall did help." Ethan Klein described Israel's military as "innovative." Here is video from July 2014 when Ethan Klein lived in Israel, and you can hear a real explosion in the background. During episode #9, Ethan Klein explained his political philosophy on immigration and refugees as "When you save one life, you save the whole world <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/IHL6HazIfQ0?t=2502">2</a>."</span> In other words, Ethan Klein supports open borders in the United States, but closed borders in Israel.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\refugees.webm"></span><br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21625&authkey=%21AIf8E0ZiARkkbh0"></video><br>Video Source: <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0rmyQfFyKw">1</a></span><br>On Aug 9, 2019 Hila Klein believed the United States should be strict against white supremacy exactly like Israel is strict against palestine. On May 12, 2021 Gal Gadot was canceled on twitter for criticizing palestine. On May 15, 2021 suddenly Ethan Klein tweeted his own support for palestine <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1393699395586052098">1</a>.</span> Ethan and Hila spent many years hating palestine, but when they noticed all the celebrities who criticized palestine were being canceled, suddenly Ethan and Hila became lovers of palestine. Ethan Klein and Hila Klein frequently change their opinions to avoid being canceled.<span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\gadot.webm"></audio></span><br>When Hila Klein said "But there is nothing happening here," she means the United States is doing nothing to stop white supremacy. Ethan Klein described Israel's military as "innovative," but he also described the United State's military as "corruption."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\corruption.webm"></audio></span><br>According to Ethan Klein, muslim immigrants in america is good, but muslim immigrants in Israel is very bad.</p>

<h1>Israelis</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan claims to love illegal immigrants but yet here is Ethan angry to hear israelis are coming here illegally.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\israeli.webm"></audio></span><br></p>

<h1>Defund the Police</h1>
<p class="two">Here is Ethan saying "I want to defund the police."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\defund.webm"></audio></span><br>Now here is a news article saying Ethan Klein lives in a $9 million gated community located in Bel Air <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dirt.com/entertainers/influencers/ethan-klein-house-bel-air-1203300328/">1</a>,</span> where Ethan pays a private armed police called "AEGIS security services." According to Aegis.com <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aegis.com/security-los-angeles-county/security-bel-air/">2</a>, they specialize in protecting "Jewish temples in Bel Air," and other "high net worth individuals." Ethan wants to defund the police, but yet he pays a private police to protect himself.</p>

<h1>Tokenism</h1>
<p class="two">Tokenism is when a white person says "I'm not racist, my friend is black." Here is an audio clip of Ethan doing tokenism. Ethan said "I'm not xenophobic, my wife is a minority."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\token.webm"></audio></span><br>And here is Ethan accusing Steven Crowder and Tucker Carlson of doing tokenism.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\steven.webm"></audio></span><br>Ethan is reacting to a news article describing how Alex Jones was caught watching transgender porn. If Alex Jones is a transphobe who enjoys transgender porn, then Ethan is a white supremacist who married a minority. Ethan has a slave owner fetish.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\alex.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Antivaxers</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan wishes death to all antivaxers.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\antivax.mp3"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Fake Apology</h1>
<p class="two">In the video "My Experience with the Police," Ethan apologized for his racist past. Ethan said "Sometimes a hypocrite is simply a man in the process of changing. And it is never too late to change for the better." The reason Ethan wants to kill antivaxers is because antivaxers are antisemitic. So if you are racist against blacks, Ethan says "It's never too late to change." But if you are antisemitic, Ethan says "Death to all of them!"</p>

<h1>Donation Shaming</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan got in trouble for donation shaming Jeff Bezos. Ethan claims it never happened. Anyways here is Ethan donation shaming Pauly Shore. Pauly Shore donated $5 to Ethan Klein's livestream, and Ethan immediately searched up Pauly Shore's net worth on google.com, and Ethan commanded Pauly Shore to donate more. Ethan's net worth was $20 million. Pauly Shore's was $30 million. If you are $1 richer than Ethan, that means you owe Ethan money.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\shore1.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\shore2.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Biased News</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan wants the New York Times to hide Alec Baldwin's criminal history.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\baldwin.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Hate Speech</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan is obsessed about policing hate speech. On episode "Off The Rails #14" Ethan declared the word "female" as being hate speech. Consequently, Ethan literally banned the word "female" from his whole entire workplace. On episode "H3TV #11" Ethan's employee AB Ayad got in trouble for accidentally uttering the word. According to Ethan, the politically correct word for "female" is "women."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\female4.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\female2.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\female3.webm"></audio></span><br>1.5 months later, and Ethan is outraged because youtube does not allow him to utter the word "cunt." Also, Ethan tweeted "Our government is run by cunts <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1342219282625699840">1</a>."</span> And Ethan constantly uses the words "bitch, pussy, and cunt" to describe people. In Ethan's mind, you are not allowed to call women cunts, you are only allowed to call straight white men cunts, because there is no history of oppression against straight white men <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1470971707338878982">2</a>.</span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\cword.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Terry Crews</h1>
<p class="two">Here is Ethan accusing Terry Crews of accepting blood money, because Terry Crews starred in an Amazon.com commercial.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\terry.webm"></audio></span><br>Here is Ethan starring in an Amazon.com commercial. Ethan said "Amazon.com is one of the best stocks you can buy" because Ethan was receiving a sales commission. Ethan hates Jeff Bezos, but when it comes to earning money, Ethan gladly sold his soul to Bezos.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\ad.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Ethan's Lawyers</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan has the best lawyers on Earth. Leonard French used the word "poetry" to describe Ethan Klein's lawyers <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/yjrjajujUCI?t=1920">1</a>.</span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\lawsuit.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\lawsuit2.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\lawsuit3.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>White Privilege</h1>
<p class="two"><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21626&authkey=%21AHfietXJdruPM1g"></video><br>Video Source: https://youtu.be/w3gXcIifc3o?t=2127<br>Ethan received a large sum of money; allegedly $1 million dollars, for free, for no reason, from a random company called Starbreeze Studios. There are news articles about it. And Ethan never denied it. Ethan only assured everyone that no crimes were committed. Almir Listo and Ethan are not close friends. There is only one explanation for this. Almir Listo thought to himself "I'm white. Ethan Klein is white. I believe in socialism. Ethan Klein believes in socialism. I am going to donate $1 million to Ethan Klein simply because I love white people who believe in socialism just like me." Literally, Ethan received $1 million for having white skin.</p>

<h1>More White Privilege</h1>
<p class="two">Here is Ethan texting the Vice President of Youtube Matt Halprin.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\vp.webm"></audio></span><br>Markiplier, Penguinz0, Philip DeFranco, and CoryxKenshin all of them struggle to receive replies from youtube. Here is Markiplier saying "Spam this message to Youtube, get them to pay attention to me. I can't get them to answer my god damn emails. I'm mad."<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21627&authkey=%21APNhCmwi2pQK7l8"></video><br></p>

<p class="two">Here is CoryxKenshin struggling to receive replies from youtube, he said "Should I spam youtube?"<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21620&authkey=%21AEILTQsLUR-BSBs"></video></p>

<p class="two">When famous youtubers email youtube for technical support, despite their fame, they still only receive computer generated replies. But not Ethan. Due to Ethan's white privilege, Ethan gets replies directly from the Vice President.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\summit.webm"></audio></span><br>Here is Ethan saying "I have a close friend who works at Youtube Headquarters," while reacting to Nasim Aghdam's mass shooting.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\nasim.webm"></audio></span><br>Here is Ethan saying "I have a friend who works at Tik-Tok."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\tiktok.webm"></audio></span><br>Finally, here is Jason Nash explaining what it feels like to have white privilege.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\privilege.webm"></audio></span></p></p>

<h1>Even More Racism</h1>
<p class="two">"And The New Host Is..." Ethan Klein celebrated the death of Herman Cain, an innocent black man who died from coronavirus. Ethan was following an internet trend called "The Herman Cain Awards."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\herman.webm"></audio></span><br>Ethan's co-host Hasan Piker explained the psychology behind why it is good to celebrate Herman Cain's death <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/uASzNUFT5Dk?t=4997">1</a>.</span> He says "Conservatives are motivated by hatred." In other words, if you associate antivaxers with dead black people, it encourages racist people to get vaccinated.</p>

<h1>Mutts</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan hates refugee animals. Imagine what he thinks about refugee humans.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\breed.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Bribery</h1>
<p class="two"><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWNi9omjqdE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWNi9omjqdE</a></span><br>Trisha Paytas said "I bribed a Jewish rabbi." Ethan Klein replied "That is very antisemitic." Anyways here is Ethan Klein saying he bribed a Jewish rabbi in order to marry Hila Klein.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\bribe.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Jake Paul</h1>
<p class="two"><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\greed.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\jakepaul.webm"></audio></span><br>Ethan Klein says the stereotype of jews being greedy isn't true, because the greediest person Ethan has ever met is Jake Paul, and Ethan says Jake Paul is not Jewish. Anyways here is proof that Jake Paul and Logan Paul are both Jewish. Video source: https://youtu.be/vUAfl-h5fkc?t=205<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21515&authkey=ALRt9xoCfzNtVqQ"></video>According to wikipedia, if you had one Jewish grandparent, you were called a "mischling." Mischlings were holocausted during world war 2.</p>

<h1>Abelist</h1>
<p class="two">Trisha Paytas speaks fake Hebrew <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/-ghb_QiB9y4?t=605">1</a>.</span> Ethan says "That's very antisemitic." Anyways here is Ethan praising a woman who did fake American Sign Language <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/lD1Z7NYUXjc?t=3875">2</a>.</span> Ethan is abelist, he hates blind people. He was playing You Laugh You lose, and he said "I love that video. I almost laughed, but I held strong."</p>

<h1>Blacked.com</h1>
<p>Trisha Paytas said "I fetishize Jewish men." Ethan replied "That's very antisemitic." But yet Ethan's favorite porn website is Blacked.com, a website which fetishizes BBC. Ethan told Bell Delphine; who is a famous pornstar, that she should try making Blacked.com porn. Ethan loves Blacked.com because he is aware interacial sex makes white supremacists feel very angry.</p>

<h1>Nanny</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan believes owning a nanny is a sign that you are poor. He believes only rich people can afford to spend quality time with their children.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\nanny.webm"></audio></span><br>The above audio is edited, I clipped together the important quotes.</p>

<h1>Prisoners</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan rudely interrupted his employee to say "society needs to stop being rude to prisoners."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\prisons.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Adpocalypse</h1>
<p class="two">This is a conspiracy theory about Ethan Klein. I believe Ethan Klein accidentally created an adpocalypse. Here are my primary sources <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/addressing-creator-feedback-and-update/">1</a>,</span><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.google/intl/en-in/products/platforms/an-update-to-our-harassment-policy/">2</a>.</span> First, here are the facts. Susan Wojcicki is the CEO of Youtube. Matt Halprin is the Vice President of Youtube. In 2019, Susan Wojcicki interviewed 8 youtubers, including Ethan Klein himself. Susan Wojcicki asked those 8 youtubers "How can I improve youtube?" As a direct result of those meetings, Susan Wojcicki and Matt Halprin updated Youtube's Hate Speech policies on December 2019. Youtube's new and improved Hate Speech policies caused an "adpocolypse." An adpocolypse is when millions of videos are demonetized for so called "Hate Speech." Which is why in order to earn a living, many youtubers resort to selling merchandise. There is a list of almost 3,000 "demonetized words." For example, if you use the word "allegation," there is a high chance your video will be demonetized. That is the truth. But now here is the conspiracy theory part: In my opinion, when Susan Wojcicki asked "How can I improve Youtube?" I believe Ethan is the only one who replied "I want youtube to be stricter on hate speech." And I believe the other 7 youtubers replied "I want to see more small creators on the trending page. And I want youtube to stop demonetizing me for copyrighted music when I only play less than 10 second clips of a song." I believe this conspiracy theory because out of all those 8 youtubers Susan Wojcicki interviewed, in my opinion, Ethan Klein is the only one who is obsessed with fighting hate speech. Here are the names of the 8 youtubers Susan Wojcicki interviewed. Korea Grandma, Prajakta Koli, Shane Dawson, James Charles, Collins and Devan Key, Ethan and Hila Klein, and Safiya Nygaard.</p>
