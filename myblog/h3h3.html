Ethan Klein said it is "super ignorant" to believe palestinians and israelis could live peacefully without borders. Hila Klein replied "When I grew up, I couldn't even ride a bus, because I was too afraid of being blown up by terrorists, and the Gaza wall did help." Ethan Klein described Israel's military as "innovative." Here is video from July 2014 when Ethan Klein lived in Israel, and you can hear a real explosion in the background. During episode #9, Ethan Klein explained his political philosophy on immigration and refugees as "When you save one life, you save the whole world <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/IHL6HazIfQ0?t=2502">2</a>."</span> In other words, Ethan Klein supports open borders in the United States, but closed borders in Israel. <br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21560&authkey=AH_pd_D1lEfNX6U" type="audio/mpeg"></span><br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21516&authkey=AAO7a2C6IGuBVuI" type="video/mp4"></video><br>Video Source: <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0rmyQfFyKw">1</a></span><br>On Aug 9, 2019 Hila Klein believed the United States should be strict against white supremacy exactly like Israel is strict against palestine. On May 12, 2021 Gal Gadot was canceled on twitter for criticizing palestine. On May 15, 2021 suddenly Ethan Klein tweeted his own support for palestine <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1393699395586052098">1</a>.</span> Ethan and Hila spent many years hating palestine, but when they noticed all the celebrities who criticized palestine were being canceled, suddenly Ethan and Hila became lovers of palestine. Ethan Klein and Hila Klein frequently change their opinions to avoid being canceled.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21564&authkey=AELxUs6VuoEK4_4" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21563&authkey=AJr2Jj0i48yKsL0" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>When Hila Klein said "But there is nothing happening here," she meant the United States is doing nothing to stop white supremacy. Ethan Klein described Israel's military as "innovative," but he also described the United State's military as "corruption."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21561&authkey=AJEZn1PaW01YDZM" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>Here is Ethan using a sarcastic analogy to argue "doing nothing about white supremacy is like doing nothing about muslim terrorists." That means Ethan hates muslims, because he thinks muslims and nazis are the same thing.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21606&authkey=AEkVvpqaCeo8LbQ" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>According to Ethan Klein, muslim immigrants in america is good, but muslim immigrants in Israel is very bad.</p>

<h1>Defund the Police</h1>
<p class="two">Here is Ethan saying "I want to defund the police."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21590&authkey=ANMVA0CRMNPx4cQ" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>Now here is a news article saying Ethan Klein lives in a $9 million gated community located in Bel Air <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dirt.com/entertainers/influencers/ethan-klein-house-bel-air-1203300328/">1</a>,</span> where Ethan pays a private armed police called "AEGIS security services." According to Aegis.com <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aegis.com/security-los-angeles-county/security-bel-air/">2</a>, they specialize in protecting "Jewish temples in Bel Air," and other "high net worth individuals." Ethan wants to defund the police, but yet he pays a private police to protect himself.</p>

<h1>Tokenism</h1>
<p class="two">Tokenism is when a white person says "I'm not racist, my friend is black." Here is an audio clip of Ethan doing tokenism. Ethan said "I'm not xenophobic, my wife is a minority."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21575&authkey=AEPhAhgFvCxOR9g" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>And here is Ethan accusing Steven Crowder and Tucker Carlson of doing tokenism.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21574&authkey=AFamQtAXPgu8-wM" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21576&authkey=AMeIy_ZQOMmF-NI" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>Ethan is reacting to a news article describing how Alex Jones was caught watching transgender porn. If Alex Jones is a transphobe who enjoys transgender porn, then Ethan is a white supremacist who married a minority. Ethan has a slave owner fetish.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21577&authkey=AD0MrhWfJ6HAz0c" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Terry Crews</h1>
<p class="two">Here is Ethan accusing Terry Crews of accepting blood money, because Terry Crews starred in an Amazon.com commercial.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21591&authkey=AA5d4Vx6sOPYBjk" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>Here is Ethan instrucing his fans to purchase stocks from Amazon.com, he said "Amazon.com is one of the best stocks you can buy" because Ethan was receiving a sales commission. Ethan hates Jeff Bezos, but when it comes to earning money, Ethan gladly sold his soul to Bezos.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21592&authkey=AE5udBSS8XXnbqc" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Donation Shaming</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan got in trouble for allegedly donation shaming Jeff Bezos. Ethan denies it ever happened.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\donation.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>Here is Ethan donation shaming Pauly Shore. Pauly Shore donated $5 to Ethan Klein's livestream, and Ethan immediately searched up Pauly Shore's net worth on google.com, and Ethan commanded Pauly Shore to donate more. Ethan's net worth was $20 million. Pauly Shore's was $30 million. If you are $1 richer than Ethan, that means you owe Ethan money.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21594&authkey=AJmYuk3r4ixwVH8" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21593&authkey=AEIVT1J_VoZjLCU" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Ethan's Lawyers</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan has the best lawyers on Earth. Leonard French used the word "poetry" to describe Ethan Klein's lawyers <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/yjrjajujUCI?t=1920">1</a>.</span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21598&authkey=AP6CpATK91tg0WA" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21597&authkey=AGQpblzDh-JrNoc" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21596&authkey=AECfm6A1Jv51fII" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span></p>

<h1>White Privilege</h1>
<p class="two"><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21532&authkey=AGeBG78ah4TyzWc" type="video/mp4"></video><br>Ethan received a large sum of money; allegedly $1 million dollars, for free, for no reason, from a random company called Starbreeze Studios. There are news articles about it. And Ethan never denied it. Ethan only assured everyone that no crimes were committed. Almir Listo and Ethan are not close friends. There is only one explanation for this. I believe Almir Listo thought to himself "I'm white. Ethan Klein is white. I believe in socialism. Ethan Klein believes in socialism. I am going to donate $1 million to Ethan Klein because I love white people who believe in socialism." Literally, Ethan received $1 million for having white skin.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="socialist.m4a" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span></p>

<h1>More White Privilege</h1>
<p class="two">Here is Ethan texting the Vice President of Youtube.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21554&authkey=AB_gSglWya0dLHs" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>Markiplier, Penguinz0, Philip DeFranco, and CoryxKenshin all of them struggle to receive replies from youtube. Markiplier tweeted #AnswerUsYoutube. Markiplier has 30.3M subscribers. Markiplier is way more famous than Ethan Klein. But yet here is Markiplier saying "Spam this message to Youtube, get them to pay attention to me. I can't get them to answer my god damn emails. I'm mad."<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21586&authkey=AFB5VwbaTCoDJc0" type="video/mp4"></video><br></p>

<p class="two">Here is CoryxKenshin struggling to receive replies from youtube, he said "Should I spam youtube?" CoryxKenshin is more famous than Ethan.<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21587&authkey=AOcs_xE4eUIpmvg" type="video/mp4"></video><br></p>

<p class="two">When famous youtubers email youtube for technical support, despite their fame, they still only receive computer generated replies. But not Ethan. Due to Ethan's white privilege, Ethan gets replies directly from the Vice President.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21601&authkey=ABHtdvN84VZcmhA" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>Here is Ethan saying "I have a close friend who works at Youtube Headquarters," reacting to Nasim Aghdam's mass shooting.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21599&authkey=AAgYq74CtpfJVG4" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>Here is Ethan saying "I have a friend who works at Tik-Tok."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3\tiktok.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>Finally, here is Jason Nash explaining what it feels like to have white privilege.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21602&authkey=APpJtlJ4E2dH3a0" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Biased News</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan gets angry whenever the news reports unbiased news. Ethan wants the New York Times to hide Alec Baldwin's criminal history.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21603&authkey=AAcdiL6OJf_soAo" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Even More Racism</h1>
<p class="two">"And The New Host Is..." Ethan Klein celebrated the death of Herman Cain, an innocent black man who died from coronavirus. Ethan was following an internet trend called "The Herman Cain Awards."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21578&authkey=ABG8OMkfw2bRWY8" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>Ethan's co-host Hasan Piker explained the psychology behind why it is good to celebrate Herman Cain's death <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/uASzNUFT5Dk?t=4997">1</a>.</span> He says "Conservatives are motivated by hatred." In other words, if you associate antivaxers with dead black people, it encourages racist people to get vaccinated.</p>

<h1>Nanny</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan believes owning a nanny is a sign that you are poor. He believes only rich people can afford to spend quality time with their children.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21604&authkey=APMRt5t4nagcCrg" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>The above audio is edited, I clipped together the important quotes. </p>

<h1>Prisoners</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan rudely interrupted his employee to say "society needs to stop being rude to prisoners." Rude to your employees is good. Rude to prisoners is very bad.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21605&authkey=ALzuhFBsMTjJiKw" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Final Words</h1>
<p>Ethan has been saying racist things for ever 5 years on youtube. On March 25, 2021 George Floyd died, and suddenly Ethan isn't racist anymore. Do you honestly believe Ethan stopped being racist that fast? Ethan never stopped being racist. He only got better at hiding his racism. On the day George Floyde died, Ethan realized to himself "This could lead to antisemitism." That's why Ethan is obsessed with fighting for the rights of minorities. Ethan doesn't care about black people. He is manipulating black people as pawns to fight w</p>
