<h1>Logical Fallacy (Pointing the Finger)</h1>
<p>In order to understand Ethan Klein, you should know the logical fallacy called "Pointing the Finger." Just because you call out another person's evil actions, it does not make your own evil actions any less evil. For example, a racist person might say "I'm not racist, look at Joe Rogan, he said the N word, he's racist, I call out racism when I see it, I'm not racist." Just because someone else is more racist, it doesn not make your own racism any less racist. Another example, on Law & Order SVU S11E2, Erik Weber is the leader of a vigilante group who catch pedophiles. It turns out Erik Weber was the biggest pedo of them all. Many Law & Order SVU episodes are based on real true crimes. That's what Ethan Klein is. Ethan is the biggest supporter of Black Lives Matter, but in reality Ethan is the most racist of them all.</p>

<h1>Ethan Says All Sluts Have Loose Vaginas</h1>
<p><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\loose.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\loose2.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\loose3.webm"></audio></span><br>Ethan says Mike Majlak is pathetic for dating the pornstar Lana Rhoades. Ethan says all sluts, milfs, and pornstars have loose vaginas, and only a cuck would dare to fuck a loose vagina like Lana Rhoades. Hila got outraged.</p>

<h1>Ethan Slut Shames</h1>
<p>Ethan says Pete Davidson is a gold digging clout chasing whore who deserves to get killed by Kanye West. When Ethan said "He fucked too close to the sun, and his dick got burned." It means Pete deserves whatever punishment he gets from Kanye West. It's like the joke Bill Burr told "There are plenty of reasons to hit women, like if she's a gold digger <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rksKvZoUCPQ">1</a>."</span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\pete2.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\pete3.webm"></audio></span></h1>

<h1>Ethan Hates Black Beauty Products</h1>
<p>Everytime you go to Walmart, the black beauty products are always locked up because of racist men like Ethan Klein. This video shows, Ethan hates Tyra Banks simply because Tyra loves vaseline.<br><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPkOYgLgGBk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPkOYgLgGBk</a></span><br>Lotions like vaseline are an essential part of black culture because dry skin appears visibly white and flakey on darker skin tones. If you don't understand that, it just shows you don't have any black friends. Ethan is xenophobic. Whenever Ethan doesn't understand something, he automatically hates that thing, and he wants to kill it. Ethan does not understand vaseline, and so he wants to destroy vaseline. By him hating vaseline, he is hating black culture. It's just so sad. Black women are always conforming to European beauty standards, and Ethan thinks it's hilarious. Literally, black women bleach their skin with toxic chemicals like hydroquinone just to appear whiter. Literally, search up on Youtube "Racist Doll Test <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/tkpUyB2xgTM?t=67">1</a></span>." Psychologists gave blacks girls a black doll and a white doll and asked them "which doll is beautiful?" and all the black girls pointed at the white doll. Also, African hair is scientifically special. Blacks are discriminated in employment for having "unprofessional hair," so that's why California has "CROWN Act" to protect blacks from being discriminated for their hair. Shut the fuck up Ethan. Stop telling black women what they should or should not wear on their skin. Ethan said "the Tyra Banks show is straight bananas." Literally called her a monkey.</p>

<h1>Ethan says Fat Women & Women with Plastic Surgery Should Be Banned From Magazines</h1>
<p><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynTkPCW2P_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynTkPCW2P_I</a></span><br>
Ethan says fatness is a symbol of laziness, and laziness should not be on magazines. Ethan praises anorexic women, he says it takes tremendous willpower to maintain a perfect skinny body. Hila agrees. Of course Hila looks like a walking skeleton. Also, Ethan says women with plastic surgery should be banned from magazines. Ethan is one those "I prefer natural beauty, no make-up, no plastic surgery, but if she's fat, she needs to hit the gym." Literally, Ethan is obese and proud, he calls his fans "my Fupa Troopers," but when women are fat, he hates it.</p>

<h1>Ethan Hates Wendy Williams</h1>
<p><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIgqznkfiE8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIgqznkfiE8</a></span><br>
Wendy Williams ate a slim jim while dressed in pajamas. Ethan says "Why did the studio producers allow Wendy Williams to be that unprofessional on television?" That's literally what white people say when they discriminate against blacks "Black people have unprofessional attitudes, unfit for the workplace."</p> 

<p>Also, Ethan hates Wendy Williams simply because Wendy is an anti-vaxer. Ethan said "Wendy Williams is so ugly, it looks like she has a gallon of botox injected on her face." Just another example of Ethan body shaming women. Let me explain why Ethan is being racist. Basically, the U.S. government is holocausting black people. George Floyd was publically executed. Would you trust your government, if you knew your goverment was holocausting your skin color? Research shows medicine is racist. The vast majority of medical research is performed on white subjects, which means medicine is designed to heal white people, and could have unintended consequences towards black people. For example, due to genetics, humans with red hair require 20% more anesthesia than normal. And how do we know that? Because white people have red hair.</p>

<h1>Ethan Hates Travis Scott</h1>
<p>Several people died in a Travis Scott concert. That's why Ethan hates Travis. Ethan says "It's not normal to die in concerts." Let me explain why Ethan is being racist. Basically, Travis Scott grew up in a ghetto neighborhood. In the ghetto, it absolutely is normal for people to die, and you become desensitized to the violence. The fact Ethan says "It's not normal to die in concerts" that just shows how much white privilege Ethan has, he has always lived in a gated white neighborhood. Many psychologists say living in the ghetto is the equivalent of living with PTSD, because every day you are exposed to violence and death.</p>

<h1>Ethan spent decades hating palestine. But when Gal Gadot was cancelled for hating palestine, suddenly Ethan turned into a "lover of palestine."</h1>
<p class="two"><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\borders.webm"></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\innovative.webm"></span><br>Based on episode "H3 Podcast #38 - Hila Klein," Ethan Klein and Hila Klein ran away from Israel in order to evade persecution from palestinian terrorists. Ethan Klein said it is "super ignorant" to believe palestinians and israelis could live peacefully without borders. Hila Klein replied "When I grew up, I couldn't even ride a bus, because I was too afraid of being blown up by terrorists, and the Gaza wall did help." Ethan Klein described Israel's military as "innovative." During episode #9, Ethan Klein explained his political philosophy on immigration and refugees as "When you save one life, you save the whole world <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/IHL6HazIfQ0?t=2502">2</a>."</span> In other words, Ethan Klein wants open borders in the United States, but closed borders in Israel.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\refugees.webm"></span><br>Here is video from July 2014 when Ethan Klein lived in Israel, and you can hear a real explosion in the background.<video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21625&authkey=%21AIf8E0ZiARkkbh0"></video><br>Video Source: <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0rmyQfFyKw">1</a></span></p>

<h1>Ethan justifies killing muslims, because he believes all muslims are anti-semitic.</h1>
<p>Ethan says we need to wage war against white supremacy exactly like the bush administration waged war against muslims. And Ethan says doing nothing about white supremacy is like doing nothing about the 9/11 terror attacks. Ethan loves bombing muslims. Context: Ethan is reacting to Neil Degrasse Tyson's tweet where Neil says viral pandemics & medical errors are a bigger issue than white supremacy.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\alqaeda2.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\islamophobic.webm"></audio></span></p>

<p>Hila Klein says the United States should be strict against white supremacy exactly like Israel is strict against palestine. When Hila Klein said "But there is nothing happening here," she means the United States is doing nothing to stop white supremacy.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\gadot.webm"></audio></span><br></p>

<p class="two">On May 12, 2021 Gal Gadot was canceled on twitter for criticizing palestine. On May 15, 2021 suddenly Ethan Klein tweeted his own support for palestine <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1393699395586052098">1</a>.</span> Ethan Klein and Hila Klein frequently change their opinions to avoid being canceled. Ethan Klein described Israel's military as "innovative," but he also described the United State's military as "corruption."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\corruption.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Ethan owns multiple mansions and armed security guards to protect himself from "White Supremacy."</h1>
<p class="two">Here is proof. Dirt.com says "The Kleins' $9 million property is located within a 24/7 guard-gated community, a lavish manor in Bel Air <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dirt.com/entertainers/influencers/ethan-klein-house-bel-air-1203300328/">1</a></span>." Aegis.com says it specializes in protecting "Jewish temples in Bel Air," and "high net worth individuals <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aegis.com/security-los-angeles-county/security-bel-air/">2</a>." Dirt.com also says "besides their new $9 million mansion, records reveal the Kleins still own a $2.3 million Encino house, and another $780,000 Woodland Hills house.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\mansion.webm"></audio></span><br>Ethan wants to defund the police, but yet he pays a private police to protect himself.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\defund.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Ethan married a foreigner so no one could accuse him of being racist.</h1>
<p class="two">Tokenism is when a white person says "I'm not racist, my friend is black." Here is an audio clip of Ethan doing tokenism. Ethan said "I'm not xenophobic, my wife is a minority."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\token.webm"></audio></span><br>And here is Ethan accusing Steven Crowder and Tucker Carlson of doing tokenism.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\steven.webm"></audio></span><br>Ethan is reacting to a news article describing how Alex Jones was caught watching transgender porn. If Alex Jones is a transphobe who enjoys transgender porn, then Ethan is a white supremacist who married a minority. Ethan has a slave owner fetish.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\alex.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Ethan says racism against blacks is forgivable, but anti-semitism should be punished with the death penalty.</h1>
<p>Ethan wishes death to all antivaxers.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\antivax.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\fakeapology.webm"></audio></span></p>

<p>Ethan spent decades hating black people, but when celebrities were cancelled for saying "All Lives Matter," suddenly Ethan turned into a "lover of black people." In the video "My Experience with the Police," Ethan apologized for his racist past. Ethan said "Sometimes a hypocrite is simply a man in the process of changing. And it is never too late to change for the better." The reason Ethan wants to kill antivaxers is because antivaxers are antisemitic. So if you are racist against blacks, Ethan says "It's never too late to change." But if you are antisemitic, Ethan says "Death to all of them!"</p>

<h1>Ethan donated $10,000 to prove that he isn't racist.</h1>
<p class="two"></p>

<h1>Trump supporters tried to cancel Ethan for "Donation Shaming Jeff Bezos." Suddenly Ethan turned into a lover of capitalism.</h1>
<p class="two"><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\donation2.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\socialist.webm"></audio></span><br>A real honest true socialist would have said "Yeah, I donation shamed Jeff Bezos. I don't give a f*ck. My philosophy is socialism." But Ethan didn't say that. Instead Ethan said "I have never donation shamed anyone in my life." Even though the exact definition of socialism is to donation shame billionaires. This shows Ethan will do and say whatever it takes to avoid being cancelled, he will even support Donald Trump to appease a hate mob. Here is Ethan donation shaming Pauly Shore. Pauly Shore donated $5 to Ethan Klein's livestream, and Ethan immediately searched up Pauly Shore's net worth on google.com, and Ethan commanded Pauly Shore to donate more. Ethan's net worth was $20 million. Pauly Shore's was $30 million. If you are $1 richer than Ethan, that means you owe Ethan money.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\shore1.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\shore2.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Hate Speech (1984)</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan says the word "female" is hate speech. Consequently, Ethan banned the word "female" from his whole entire workplace. On episode "H3TV #11" Ethan's employee AB Ayad got in trouble for accidentally uttering the word. According to Ethan, the politically correct word for "female" is "women."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\female4.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\female2.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\female3.webm"></audio></span><br>1.5 months later, and Ethan is outraged because youtube does not allow him to utter the word "cunt." Also, Ethan tweeted "Our government is run by cunts <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1342219282625699840">1</a>."</span> And Ethan constantly uses the words "bitch, pussy, and cunt" to describe people. In Ethan's mind, you are not allowed to call women cunts, you are only allowed to call straight white men cunts, because there is no history of oppression against straight white men <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1470971707338878982">2</a>.</span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\cword.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>Ethan's Lawyers</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan has the best lawyers on Earth. Leonard French used the word "poetry" to describe Ethan Klein's lawyers <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/yjrjajujUCI?t=1920">1</a>.</span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\lawsuit.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\lawsuit2.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\lawsuit3.webm"></audio></span></p>

There are news articles about it. And Ethan never denied it. Ethan only assured everyone that no crimes were committed. Almir Listo and Ethan are not close friends. There is only one explanation for this. Almir Listo thought to himself "I'm white. Ethan Klein is white. I believe in socialism. Ethan Klein believes in socialism. I am going to donate $1 million to Ethan Klein simply because I love white people who believe in socialism just like me." Literally, Ethan received $1 million for having white skin.</p>

<h1>More White Privilege</h1>
<p class="two">Here is Ethan texting the Vice President of Youtube Matt Halprin.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\vp.webm"></audio></span><br>Markiplier, Penguinz0, Philip DeFranco, and CoryxKenshin all of them struggle to receive replies from youtube.

<p class="two">When famous youtubers email youtube for technical support, despite their fame, they still only receive computer generated replies. But not Ethan. Due to Ethan's white privilege, Ethan gets replies directly from the Vice President.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\summit.webm"></audio></span><br>Here is Ethan saying "I have a close friend who works at Youtube Headquarters," while reacting to Nasim Aghdam's mass shooting.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\nasim.webm"></audio></span><br>Here is Ethan saying "I have a friend who works at Tik-Tok."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\tiktok.webm"></audio></span><br>Finally, here is Jason Nash explaining what it feels like to have white privilege.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\privilege.webm"></audio></span></p></p>

<h1>Even More Racism</h1>
<p class="two">"And The New Host Is..." Ethan Klein celebrated the death of Herman Cain, an innocent black man who died from coronavirus. Ethan was following an internet trend called "The Herman Cain Awards."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\herman.webm"></audio></span><br>Ethan's co-host Hasan Piker explained the psychology behind why it is good to celebrate Herman Cain's death <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/uASzNUFT5Dk?t=4997">1</a>.</span> He says "Conservatives are motivated by hatred." In other words, if you associate antivaxers with dead black people, it encourages racist people to get vaccinated.</p>

<h1>Vegans tried to cancel Ethan for purchasing Shredder. Suddenly, Ethan "rescued" Alfredo.</h1>
<p class="two">The only reason Ethan rescued Alfredo is because there was a hate mob. And Ethan did not rescue just any random dog. He rescued a purebred maltese <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B2M9DHrgtcz/?utm_source=ig_embed">1</a>,</span> his favorite breed. Let me explain why this is so fucked up. So basically, Kill Shelters will take any dog no matter what. But No Kill Shelter reserve the right to deny any dog. No Kill Shelters look at your dog and if your dog is ugly, they will say to your face "I'm sorry, our facility is full at this moment. We're not accepting dogs right now." No one wants to adopt ugly old mutt dogs with missing limbs, they only want to adopt cute perfect purebred puppies. So all the ugly dogs never get adopted or they end up in Kill Shelters because of people like Ethan Klein.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\breed.webm"></audio></span><br>Listen to this story, and find out what happens to cute animals once they turn ugly.

<h1>Taxes</h1>
<p class="two"><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\mexico.webm"></audio></span><br>Ethan hates mexico because they charged him 15% taxes. Ethan vowed to never visit mexico ever again. He says there is too much taxes, crime, and corruption in mexico. But it's not Ethan's fault. He says it's white people's fault. Ethan's not white, he's jewish. It's definitely not Ethan's fault, a man who travels to mexico just for fun with a $5,000 camera while the whole country of mexico is literally poor. 44% of mexicans live below the poverty line, and Ethan's family is lugging around cameras and high definition televisions.</p>

<h1>Adpocalypse</h1>
<p class="two">This is a conspiracy theory about Ethan Klein. I believe Ethan Klein accidentally created an adpocalypse. Here are my primary sources <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/addressing-creator-feedback-and-update/">1</a>,</span><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.google/intl/en-in/products/platforms/an-update-to-our-harassment-policy/">2</a>.</span> First, here are the facts. Susan Wojcicki is the CEO of Youtube. Matt Halprin is the Vice President of Youtube. In 2019, Susan Wojcicki interviewed 8 youtubers, including Ethan Klein. Susan Wojcicki asked those 8 youtubers "How can I improve youtube?" As a direct result of those meetings, Susan Wojcicki and Matt Halprin updated Youtube's Hate Speech policies on December 2019. Youtube's new and improved Hate Speech policies caused an adpocolypse. An adpocolypse is when millions of videos are demonetized for so called "Hate Speech." Which is why in order to earn a living, many youtubers resort to selling merchandise. There is a list of almost 3,000 "demonetized words." For example, if you use the word "allegation," there is a high chance your video will be demonetized. That is the truth. But now here is the conspiracy theory part: When Susan Wojcicki asked "How can I improve Youtube?" I believe Ethan is the only one who replied "I want youtube to be stricter on hate speech." I believe this conspiracy theory because out of all those 8 youtubers Susan Wojcicki interviewed, Ethan is the only one who is obsessed about fighting hate speech. Here are the names of the 8 youtubers Susan Wojcicki interviewed. Korea Grandma, Prajakta Koli, Shane Dawson, James Charles, Collins and Devan Key, Ethan and Hila Klein, and Safiya Nygaard. And if you read the article, there is evidence the other youtubers did not ask to fight hate speech, instead they said "I want to see more small creators on the trending page. And I want youtube to stop demonetizing me for copyrighted music when I only play less than 10 second clips of a song."</p>

<h1>Drapetomania</h1>
<p>These are the names of the black people Ethan hates. Ethan hates it when black people have opinions.<img src="images\degrasse2.webp">When a slave displayed signs of intelligence, slave owners accused their slave of suffering from a fake mental disorder called Drapetomania, and it discouraged the slave from pursuing knowledge. Similarly, Ethan accuses all black people of suffering from "oppression." When a black person refuses to accept the oppression narrative, that is what Ethan hates the most. Seriously, the angriest I ever saw Ethan is when Neil Degrasse Tyson said white supremacy is a minor issue compared to the possibility of a future viral pandemic <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/1158074774297468928">1</a>.</span> And Neil Degrasse Tyson's theory was correct because literally 5 months later COVID-19 happened. Seriously, click on that tweet, and all you will see is white liberals attacking Neil in the comments. White liberals are literally gaslighting black people. "You have oppression. You can't fix yourself. I'm the only who can fix you."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\neil.webm"></audio></span><br>Ethan literally told Neil to "shut the fuck up." And if you listen to the whole podcast, Ethan says worse things.</p>

<p>Ethan said "Smoke DeGrasse Tyson." That is like saying "All black love to smoke marijuana."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\degrasse1.webm" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span></p>

<p>Hila said "Hey twitter world, it's yours truly," a reference to OJ Simpson's famous catch phrase. That is like saying "Neil Tyson is a stupid N word, no different than OJ Simpson. All black people are the same." In a previous episode, Ethan & Hila called OJ Simpson "a known murderer."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="h3h3%20opus\truly.webm" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span></p>

<p>Daniel Swerdlove said "This sh*t makes me miss Carl Sagan." That is like saying "Neil Tyson is so stupid. He is a knock off version of a white scientist." "Sh*t" is a reference to Neil Tyson's brown skin color.</p>
