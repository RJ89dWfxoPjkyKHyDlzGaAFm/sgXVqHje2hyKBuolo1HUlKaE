<h1>Palestine vs Israel</h1>

<p class="two"><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21562&authkey=AJxHNo4zMgoAZfw" type="audio/mpeg"></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21559&authkey=AHX00G0bXML7eeU" type="audio/mpeg"></span><br>Based on episode "H3 Podcast #38 - Hila Klein," Ethan Klein and Hila Klein ran away from Israel in order to evade persecution from palestinian terrorists. Ethan Klein said it is "super ignorant" to believe palestinians and israelis could live peacefully without borders. Hila Klein replied "When I grew up, I couldn't even ride a bus, because I was too afraid of being blown up by terrorists, and the Gaza wall did help." Ethan Klein described Israel's military as "innovative." Here is video from July 2014 when Ethan Klein lived in Israel, and you can hear a real explosion in the background. During episode #9, Ethan Klein explained his political philosophy on immigration and refugees as "When you save one life, you save the whole world <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/IHL6HazIfQ0?t=2502">2</a>."</span> In other words, Ethan Klein supports open borders in the United States, but closed borders in Israel. <br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21560&authkey=AH_pd_D1lEfNX6U" type="audio/mpeg"></span><br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21516&authkey=AAO7a2C6IGuBVuI" type="video/mp4"></video><br>Video Source: <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0rmyQfFyKw">1</a></span><br>On Aug 9, 2019 Hila Klein believed the United States should be strict against white supremacy exactly like Israel is strict against palestine. On May 12, 2021 Gal Gadot was canceled on twitter for criticizing palestine. On May 15, 2021 suddenly Ethan Klein tweeted his own support for palestine <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1393699395586052098">1</a>.</span> Ethan and Hila spent many years hating palestine, but when they noticed all the celebrities who criticized palestine were being canceled, suddenly Ethan and Hila became lovers of palestine. Ethan Klein and Hila Klein frequently change their opinions to avoid being canceled.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21564&authkey=AELxUs6VuoEK4_4" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21563&authkey=AJr2Jj0i48yKsL0" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>When Hila Klein said "But there is nothing happening here," she meant the United States is doing nothing to stop white supremacy. Ethan Klein described Israel's military as "innovative, but he also described the United State's military as "corruption."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21561&authkey=AJEZn1PaW01YDZM" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>According to Ethan Klein, muslim immigrants in america is good, muslim immigrants in Israel is very bad.</p>

<h1>Homophobia</h1>
<p class="two">The same way Ethan believes grown men should not watch kpop, Ethan also believes grown men should not play minecraft. Ethan believes all grown men who watch kpop or play minecraft are homosexual pedophiles. So that explains why Ethan created this video portraying minecraft players as sexual deviants.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21548&authkey=ANUMHLJr7RDuHS4" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21565&authkey=AFvyw_3gypnAcZE" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<h1>Sexual Harassment</h1>
<p class="two">Due to the above video, on August 11, 2021 Ethan Klein was suspended from Youtube for 7 days because Ethan Klein broke Youtube's "bullying and sexual harassment" policy. The reason is because Ethan simulated having sex with a red puppet. The puppet is based on a real man named Daniel Keem. Whenever Ethan hates you, he makes a doll of you and has sex with it on camera to make you feel worthless and weak. Remember when Ethan said "I care about male victims of sexual abuse." Now imagine if Ethan owned a doll of a woman like Candance Owens and Ethan raped it for a "funny" video.<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21570&authkey=AFdT0w9qbf4Fxc0" type="video/mp4"></video><br>On July 4, 2020 Ethan saw this creepy Shane Dawson video. Four months later, suddenly Ethan Klein owns a Daniel Keem puppet. This creepy video literally inspired Ethan.</p>

<h1>Sexism</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan Klein said "I care about male victims of sexual abuse." Here is Ethan Klein not giving a f*ck about the male victim of sexual abuse Spencer Elden. Spencer Elden is the naked baby on the Nirvana album artwork. Spencer Elden filed a lawsuit claiming to be a male victim of child pornography. Ethan Klein described Spencer Elden's lawsuit as "obviously a cashgrab." Ethan Klein believes Spencer Elden is acting like a victim for financial gain.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21572&authkey=AJRyJGE4C9tCGpg" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21571&authkey=AMqrYEiZJDHpv9A" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21573&authkey=APRgCnqYL61Kjh4" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>The porn actresses Lana Rhoades and Mia Khalifa both believe if a woman does porn but later regrets doing porn, she should have the legal right to change her mind whenever she feels like it, and have the legal right to remove her old porn videos from the internet. Why is it different if Spencer Elden wants to remove his own naked photo from an album cover?</p>

<h1>Tokenism</h1>
<p class="two">Tokenism is when a white person says "I'm not racist, my friend is black." Here is an audio clip of Ethan doing tokenism. Ethan said "I'm not xenophobic, my wife is a minority."<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21575&authkey=AEPhAhgFvCxOR9g" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>And here is Ethan accusing Steven Crowder and Tucker Carlson of doing tokenism.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21574&authkey=AFamQtAXPgu8-wM" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21576&authkey=AMeIy_ZQOMmF-NI" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>Ethan is reacting to a news article describing how Alex Jones was caught watching transgender porn. If Alex Jones is transphobic but watches trangender porn, then that means Ethan is a racist who married a minority. If anything it makes Ethan more racist, because Ethan has a slave owner fetish.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21577&authkey=AD0MrhWfJ6HAz0c" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span></p>
