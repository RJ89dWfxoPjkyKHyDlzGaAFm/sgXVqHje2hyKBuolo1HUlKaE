<h1>Paternal Uncertainty</h1>

<p>Please watch this one video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VWFreC4onI">[1]</a>. The video shows how male beatles fight other male beatles, and climb the tallest trees, all of this work for one single purpose. To have sex with females. Once the male beatle is finished having sex, he throws the female off a tree. Due to the insect's size, the female survives the fall. However, the female beatle is left pregnant and alone in this world. Meanwhile, the male beatle moves onto to the next female. This video perfectly depicts Paternal Uncertainty.</p>

<p>Paternal Uncertainty in humans, it means men crave to have sex with a variety of different women. Meanwhile, women are extremely selective about who she will have sex with. Men crave sex with different women, because men have nothing to lose from it. If a man impregnates a woman, he can always abandon her and abondon his offspring. Meanwhile, if a woman is pregnant, she will be pregnant for the next 9 months. Those 9 months of pregnancy she will be unable to work, and her body will require specific dietary nutrients. A woman can die from being pregnant. So in order for women to enjoy sex, she needs to feel like her man will not abandon her during her pregnancy, and that her man will provide her with food and resources during her pregnancy. This explains why women are gold diggers, and men are perverts. The horniest men were sex addicts who passed the horny gene. Women have difficulty leaving abusive relationships because she is afraid of that abandonment. Women never had pregnancy tests, so her primitive brain believes divorce means being abandoned in the wilderness and pregnant.</p>

<p>As the saying goes "Words attract women, that is why men tell lies. Physical beauty attracts men, that is why women wear makeup <a href="https://media.santabanta.com/images/picsms/2015/sms-15458.jpg">[1]</a>."</p>

<p>Another facet of Paternal Uncertainty in humans, it means men do anything to avoid the phrase "You Are Not The Father." Mortal men wrote in the christian bible, muslim bible, and hindu bible "Thou shalt not have premarital sex," because it made men feel secure from believing their wife is chaste or a virgin, meaning he is the only man who could be the father. Women are not allowed to enjoy sex. If women enjoy sex, she might have sex with different people. Men will not know who is the father.</p>

<p>Paternal uncertainty is not an internal dialogue men have to themselves. It is instead the manifestation of this strong jealous emotion which may lead to aggresssion and violence. Some men are deluded into believing he may not be the father, so he neglects his offsprings, and even murders his own family. He murders his own family to send the message that all women must remain chaste virgins or else there will be punishments. In India and China, women are burned alive for being sluts <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17625-3">[1]</a> <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/tiktok-star-burned-alive-ex-22777402">[2]</a>, called Bridal Burnings and Eve Teasing. Eve Teasing means ostensibly women are asking to be raped with the clothes she wears, because in the bible Eve sexually seduced Adam into eating the forbidden fruit. Eve Teasing means ostensibly rape is always the woman's fault for being a tease. In Africa, the clitoris is removed to prevent women from becoming sluts <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/female-genital-mutilation">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>Paternal Uncertainty explains why we physically resemble our parents. Offsprings with the gene that makes you resemble your parents lived longer, because their father wouldn't kill or neglect an offspring that looks like him since it provides paternal certainty.</p>

<p>I know this is barbaric, but it is an evolutionary instinct since the majority of human history there were neither condoms, nor paternity tests.</p>  

<p>Men are biologically wired to fight until the strongest men survive, and the weakest men are supposed to die. This explains why men created racism, and started every war in history.</p> 


<p>The agricultural revolution began around 10,000BCE. Scientists in 2018 reported the first Homo Sapiens existed 300,000 years ago <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2018.05.005">[1]</a>. 300,000-12,018=287,982 and 287,982รท300,000=96%. 96% of Homo Sapien history was hunting and gathering. In other words, 96% of our brain believes we are a hunter gatherer. This explains why humans today behave like savages. 4% of our modernized brain argues against the other 96% of our primitive brain.</p>


<p>When a Male Zebra believes he is not the father, he perpetrates infanticide on cubs <a href="https://youtu.be/s8jg2wbisIs">[1]</a>. Same for Male Lions <a href="https://youtu.be/KUGf-irpTMQ?t=96">[2]</a>. Coincidentally, this woman testified that her exboyfriend murdered his step-children <a href="https://youtu.be/1-OQV4b9m3g">[2]</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2017/03/08/a-woman-married-a-paroled-murderer-years-later-he-killed-all-her-children/">[3]</a>. Step-children means he is not the father.</p>

<p>DJ Khaled explained why he doesn't do cunnilingus on his wife <a href="https://youtu.be/W87MssOF7nY?t=453">[1]</a>, spoiler, women are not allowed to enjoy sex.</p>

<p>Clifford Joseph Harris Jr, also known as the musician "TI" forced his 18 year old daughter to suffer a virginity test <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/06/ti-teen-daughter-sex-doctor-gynecologist-still-virgin-hymen/">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>African men cut the clitoris to prevent women from becoming sluts, there are 200 million surviving women who suffered Female Genital Mutilation <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/female-genital-mutilation">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>In the United States during 2014 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/interactives/global-morality/">[3]</a>, 30% believed premarital sex is "unacceptable," 29% believed premarital sex is "acceptable," 36% believed premarital sex is "not a moral issue."<p>

<p>Research says men and women experience jealousy differently <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1467-9280.1992.tb00038.x">[1]</a>. Men are jealous from the idea of his woman having sex with another person. Women are jealous from the idea of her man being in love with another person.</p>

<p>When given the opportunity to have unpaid heterosexual sexual intercourse with a random person of average attractiveness, 75% of men and 0% women would glady participate <a href="https://doi.org/10.1300/J056v02n01_04">[1]</a>. In other words, men will have sex with just about any random woman, but women are specific about who they decide to have sex with.</p>
