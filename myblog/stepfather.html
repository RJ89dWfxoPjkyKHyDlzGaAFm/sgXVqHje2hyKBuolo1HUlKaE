<h1>Step-Father</h1>

<p>All through my life, my mother always told me "Don't believe anything that your step-father says. He is a pathological liar." I didn't understand what my mother meant by that, until one day something happened that made me realize what my mother had warned me.</p>

<p>When I was a young adult, there was a few months that I wasn't living with my parents. My parents' had been taking care of my two parakeet birds. When I returned home, immediately, I realized something was different about one of my birds. The bird's facial expressions. I announced to my family "My bird died. You are trying to trick me." My step-father said "No. It's the same bird. He lost his feather, when it grew back, it's possible, maybe his feathers slightly changed." I tried my best to believe his story. I started crying. It was obvious they were lying to me. Then the next day, my step-father said "I am sorry we lied to you. Here is the truth. Your nephew noticed your bird was stiff on the floor of the bird cage. I didn't want to hurt his feelings, he is just a kid, so I lied. I told him, the bird was sleeping. Then, we got a new bird to protect your nephew, and we thought maybe you wouldn't notice either."

<p>So then I asked my nephew if he had ever witnessed my bird was asleep on the cage floor. My nephew replied "No. That never happened. I knew your bird was dead. We all knew your bird died. I helped them choose the new bird. Everyone knew. Even my mom and dad knew. Everyone planned to trick you."</p>

<p>So my step-father lied to me three times. Before I returned home, my step-father reassured me that my birds were thriving. When I returned home, I noticed they replaced my bird, my step-father denied it. Then, when my step-father confessed that he tried to trick me, he told me a fake story about my nephew. It was really messed up. In his mind, he lied to protect my feelings. In reality, he lied to protect his own feelings. It just hurts me because to this day my relatives won't tell me how my bird died. The fact they lied, it makes me feel like my bird had a preventable death. The fact my step-father lied, I became paranoid believing that my step-father purposefully killed my parakeet bird. I know it sounds crazy. But just listen. My step-father's nickname among all his friends and family is "Perico." Everyone calls him that. In Spanish "Perico" means parakeet. I feel like what if my step-father used to murder parakeets in Mexico and that is how he got his nickname. I know it sounds crazy. But literally that is how messed up Mexican men are.</p>

<h1>Mexicans</h1>
<p>When I was a young adult, one time a Mexican-American man paid me $80 to fix his computer. I don't own a business, I was just doing him a favor. I had a 16GB USB to backup his files to do a clean installation of Windows 10. I had to delete some files to fit on my 16GB USB. On his hardrive, I accidentally found a video of him and his friends forcing a pitbull to drink beer. In the video, there are 4 Mexican men, 1 is holding the camera, 1 is holding the dog down, 1 is holding a plastic funnel into the dog's mouth, and 1 is pouring beer in the plastic funnel, and they are all laughing. It's so sad. In the background there is a dog bowl of water, and the water is filthy. I didn't know what to do, so I asked my family what I should do. And literally noone cared. My step-father replied "Oh yeah. Hahah my brothers and I did that to a dog once in Mexico. Don't worry about it. Some dogs love to drink beer."</p>

<h1>Truth or Lie</h1>

<p>One time my step-father said "When I was a kid, my father owned a loyal dog in Mexico. When my father died, that dog escaped his enclosure. We searched everywhere for our missing dog, when we found the dog he was laying down in front of my father's grave stone."</p>

<p>One time my step-father "I know my accent is weird. When I was a kid, a doctor told me my tongue is too small, so that's why my accent is weird. My father put hot sauce on my tongue to stretch my tongue, and it helped a little bit."</p>

<p>One time my step-father said "When I was a kid, a deranged criminal broke into my home. My father grabbed his shotgun, and chased the criminal away. The criminal was very far away, but my father shot his shotgun at him. The bullet missed. My father had to send a message to the criminals because we lived in a country of lawlessness. If my father didn't shoot his shotgun, then the criminals might return again."</p>

<p>One time my step-father said "I was born and raised in a violent country in Mexico. When I was a kid, it was normal for me to see human dead bodies on the public roads. One time my friends and I stumbled upon a decapitated head, and we laughed at it. One friend got a piece of string, he put the string inside the decapitated head's mouth, and pretended like the string was a fishing rod, like he was trying to catch a wild fish. We all laughed at it. I know it sounds messed up. But it's because we were kids, we didn't know how to process the fact we were seeing dead bodies. We used humor to lessen the trauma. Don't tell your mother this, but when I was a teenager in Mexico I used to kill snakes. Now that I'm an adult, I realized it was wrong what I did. It was the traumatic environment I grew up in."</p>

<p>My step-father always goes to the bathroom, and literally everyone hears him vomitting in there. One time I straight up asked him if he is bulimic, he said "No. That sound is me brushing my tongue, and sometimes it makes me gag." Literally, when he is done vomitting, the sink stinks like vomit, and there is remnants of pink residue like guava juice kernals. Even my mother agrees he is vomitting in there. My step-father comes from a family of morbidly obese people. My step-father's brother is morbidly obese, he married a woman who is even more obese, and together they produced children who are so obese they could be on the television series "My 600lb life <a href="https://youtu.be/K8nrRKUo598">[1]</a>." My step-father is afraid he might be like that one day, but so far he isn't, and maybe it's because he occassionally forces himself to vomit.</p>

<p>When I was kid, there was a cabinet of VHS movies, mostly cartoons. One memory stood out to me. One time I found a VHS called "Faces of Death," it had this scary cartoon picture on it <a href="https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/fod.jpg">[1]</a>. On the back cover it had a scary disclaimer on it. I never watched it. But when I was an adult, I remembered the title, I googled the name of it, and learned it is a movie that shows real videos of people being killed. I don't understand why or how did my step-father have that movie. That's why I am saying it's possible he murdered my parakeet.</p>

<p>For a long time, my step-father had a casio flip phone. His brother asked "Why don't you buy a smartphone?" My step-father said "I am never going to buy a smartphone. Smartphones are for gay people. You're swiping your finger on that smartphone, you look like a gay person." Then one day my step-father said "My phone service contract is being renewed. The Verizon employees told me I had to replace my phone. My flip phone was practically broken anyways. So then I asked why is my phone bill so expensive. The employees said I used the internet too much. Then I showed them my phone, and they were shocked I had a flip phone. They said they made a mistake. And now they are giving me a huge refund. All these years they put a smartphone plan on my flip phone. I am done with Verizon. I changed companies, and now I have this smartphone." And just like that all of a sudden my step-father was addicted to his smartphone. He was addicted. Even though for years, he was against smartphones. In the first week of him owning his first smartphone, he was sitting on the sofa using his smartphone when suddenly there was a loud woman moaning sex noises originating from his smartphone. We all heard it. It lasted like 5 whole seconds. Then my step-father blushed and stammered "My brother... he sent me, erh whatever..." Everyone pretended like we didn't hear it. I honestly think his brothers played a prank on him, because later on, I heard that noise again from his smartphone while he scrolls through facebook, like it is a famous mexican meme noise. In the first month of him owning his first smartphone, he had malware on it, his phone was unusable due to all the malware popup advertisments.</p>

<p>In the beginning, he my step-father was obsessed with his smartphone. I showed him how to use chromecast. Then one day my step-father put a video on the television, it was video compilations of minor vehicle accidents. Then one day my step-father put a video on the television, it was a weird video. I wish I had the link. Anyways, it is a video of a man who kills coyotes. He goes around with his dogs, and he shoots coyotes with his gun. Then another guy uses night vision to kill coyotes. My step-father said "He has to kill them. Otherwise, the coyotes can kill his livestock." Then one day my step-father was scrolling through facebook, he started laughing, so I asked him what was so funny, and he showed me the video. It was messed up. The video was a chicken was asleep, then a guy put a loudspeaker next to the chicken, and he played very loud music. The chicken woke up screaming. Literally, my step-father is crazy. Sometimes, he is just on his phone scolling through facebook and I hear the noise of dogs crying, but I didn't see the video. One noise was really terrible. I heard a pig squeeling. I didn't see the video, but it sounded like the pig was crying for his life, like he was about to be killed. And I kept hearing that noise like it was a meme. My step-father is crazy. He literally watches and laughs at videos of animals being tortured and killed or something like that. Or I don't know. Because I only hear the animals crying, but I don't see the videos. I am too afraid of asking. Maybe he is watching memes or pranks videos and the background audio is the sound of animals crying. Like if a grown man falls down, they might play the animal crying noises to be like "Haha look at that grown a*s man, he is cried like b***h."</p>
