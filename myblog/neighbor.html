<h1>Knock at My Door</h1>
<p>One day I was just at home when I heard a mysterious knocking noise at my door. I opened the door, and it was a latina woman, she was my neighbor whom I rarely ever seen, she only spoke spanish, she said "Please, I need your help. Can you tell your aunt to help me? Please, tell her I will be waiting for her outside in front of my house. It's very important. Thank you." I told my aunt. My aunt went to her. And that was how this crazy story unfolded.</p>

<h1>Stockholm Syndrome</h1>
<p>I don't have all the details, because my family keeps secrets from me. However, the reason why I rarely saw this latina woman who was my neighbor, is because she was being abused by her latino husband. She was not allowed to have a job or leave her house. She lived with this man for so many decades, and her husband never purchased menstrual products for her.</p>

<h1>Why Mexico?</h1>
<p>So the woman asked my aunt to research a bus schedule that will take her to Mexico. I don't know if she took a plane or bus, but she is gone now. The reason why that woman left to Mexico. I don't really know. But it has something to do with her 11 year old son. Basically, her 11 year old was bullying kids at his middle school. The school counselors interviewed him, and discovered he was being abused by his mother. The only thing they told me is that ever since he was a baby in the crib, his mother yelled at him "You're ugly. You're worthless. I hate you. Kill yourself." The mother admitted that she was abusing her son like this. She said she was psychologically broken, and that was why she had to leave to Mexico to protect her sons. To be honest, I think she was running away from the police, but I honesty don't know. She has two sons. The 11 year old, and another who was probably like 4 years old at the time. Her two sons still remain here in the United States with that husband man person.</p>

<h1>In the Past</h1>
<p>Before all of this abuse was exposed. Everyone in my family hated that 11 year old kid. Even when he was younger, he was a bully. One time my nephew's brand new toy weapon went missing. My nephew's mother went to that kid, and demanded "Give us back our toy!" The kid said "I don't know where it's at. But I can help you search for it." Then out of nowhere, the kid said "Oh look the toy is over there." My newphew's mother said "I had already checked that place. That kid was hiding the toy and pretended like he found it. That kid is a psychopath." So then my nephew's mother examined that the toy weapon was broken, she said to the kid "Stop destroying our toys! Leave us alone!" The kid replied "I didn't break it. Maybe your son accidentally broke it, but he's lying to you because he doesn't want you to yell at him the way you are yelling at me."</p>

<p>My step-father is a known clinical pathological liar, not the most trustworthy source, but he said "That kid is a psychopath. The other day, some children were playing soccer, the ball landed on our property, I tossed it back to them. The next day, I saw that same ball again, only this time it was flat on that demented kid's lawn. I have a bad feeling about that kid. I think he stabbed a hole in the ball out of jealousy."</p>

<p>One time, my 6 year old nephew was with that kid, I said to my nephew "Your mom said you have to go home and eat." Immediately, that kid whispered something in my newphew's ear. I asked my nephew what did the kid tell him, my nephew said "He told me that I shouldn't listen to you. That you are lying and playing a prank on me. That I should stay there and continue playing outside along with him." That kid was trying to get my nephew in trouble.</p>

<p>My father said "Everytime I've gone to your house, for years, I observed the only toy that poor kid ever had is that one orange toy truck in the dirt. He's had no other toys." I replied "Maybe he feels insecure when other kids have toys, because he's never had toys himself."</p> 



<h1>After the Party</h1>
<p>We had a small family party in our yard. There was music, food, and alcohol. I thought it was a peaceful party. The next day, I learned it was not a peaceful party at all. The day after that party happened, my latina neighbor said "On the day of the party, I couldn't find my cat, I thought she went missing. I saw that kid and his younger brother were playing outside. I asked that kid if he knew where my cat went. That kid pointed me in the right direction. I found my cat. I asked him how did he know where my cat went, and why was my cat trembling, he said he saw his younger brother trying to hug my cat, and the cat ran away. I have a bad feeling about that kid. I think he did something to harm cat."</p>

<p>The next thing I learned was, during that same party my uncle was about to be in a fist fight with my one latino neighbor, the one neighbor who is the father of that kid everyone says is a psychopath. I was so annoyed at my uncle. I assumed it was my uncle's fault, because one time my drunk uncle got in a fist fight with my other drunk uncle. My drunk uncle said "You are a son of a b***h!" My other drunk uncle replied "We have the same mother! That means you called your own mother a b***h!" My drunk uncle replied "Don't you dare call my mother a b***h! She gave birth to you!" And they started punching eachother. So then I learned why my uncle was about to fight my latino neighbor. It's because at the party, my latino neighbor was saying disgusting vile things about my uncle's sister who is my mother, he said "I love your sister. I've loved her ever since I moved here. I want to have sex with her. When her husband dies, I will be there to replace him... And what are you going to do about it?" So then my uncle replied "I'm gonna kill you right now." They were arguing on the street roads until finally my drunk uncle said "On second thought, I'm tired. I've been in too many fights in my life. I have work tomorrow. You're not worth my time. Goodbye."</p>

<h1>My Anxiety</h1>
<p>Let me reiterate this. During the party, my latino neighbor was saying disgusting vile things about my own mother. I was astonished. I went around my whole family and said "We've never spoken to our neighbor, besides casual greetings, and this is what he finally tells us? Something is not right here. Normal people are nice at first, and then the craziness comes out once you get to know them. This man revealed his craziness on the first impression. Can you even imagine how crazy he is once you actually get to know him? The school counselor said that kid was being abused by his mother. But I heard nothing about his father. I really wasn't sure what to believe about him. I had no proof that he was crazy, only a speculation. But now I have proof. This man should be in prison." Literally, noone in my family cared about what I had to say. They just ignored me.</p>

<h1>Cigarettes</h1>
<p>About one year after the party, I was walking a dog when I saw my nieghbor's kid. He started talking to me. He was very intelligent. He said "I love Marvel comics. The creator Stan Lee recently died. I often visit my school's library to read the Marvel comics there." I asked the kid "What is that on your legs?" He replied "I am certain you heard about my mother moving to Mexico. My parents were both crazy. Whenever I misbehaved, and my father doesn't do this anymore, but he used to burn me with his cigarettes on my legs." I replied "Why do you wear shorts when you have scars on your legs." He said "Because it happened a long time ago. Those scars are fading. I just like to wear shorts. If anyone asks I just tell them I have mosquitos bites, no one asks me further questions. They don't even notice my legs, literally every kid has scars on their legs from falling on their skateboards." I didn't need to ask him any questions, he just kept on talking and talking and asking me questions about myself until finally he said "And my mother threatened to kill me with a knife, she would tell me that she planned to chop me up into pieces, boil me into a soup, so they wouldn't find my body. I was just a kid. That's why I had anger issues, and I was a bully back then. I only have one scar on my leg where my mother cut me with a hot knife." I also learned that he owns a videogame console, and he likes to play videogames on his phone, but his younger brother accidentally broke his phone. Probably the most concerning thing that kid told me was when he said "My dad uses the internet a lot. He is always on his smartphone. As soon as he wakes up he is on his phone for many hours. He is looking at naked women." I asked "How do you know the women are naked?" He said "I saw it before. Over his shoulder. He doesn't care. He puts it on the television. He says it's natural."</p>

<p>I know you are thinking this is fake. I don't know. Maybe the kid is lying to me. This happened a long time ago, before we found out he was being abused. But one time my step-father and I were walking next to that kid's home, and we heard that kid screaming and crying, and my step-father said to me "Ugh, I hate that stupid kid. He's so nnoying. How old is? And he is still crying like an infant. And he's so disgusting and fat. I hope they are beating his a** so he could stop acting like a baby." One time my sister said "That kid always has wet bugers on his upper lip, I don't want my sons talking to that psychopath." It's so sad how even grown ups outcasted this poor kid.</p>

<h1>More Anxiety</h1>
<p>I was going crazy again. I went to my entire family and said "I had never spoken to that kid ever before, and that is what he tells me. Why would he tell me all those personal things? I think he wants to confess something to me. I have a very bad feeling about what he said that his dad watches porn. How are we just going to sit here and do nothing?" My mother replied "There's nothing we could do about this. The child protective services are involved already. They are specialized in this topic, they will know what to do next." So that's the end of this story. I am literally living next to a deranged criminal who is obsessed with my own mother even though he has never spoken to her. Apparently, there's nothing I could do about it. I told my mother and my step-father about it, I told them we have to be careful around this man. They didn't care. But my other relatives got mad at me. They told me I should keep my mouth shut, or else my step-father will get jealous and start beating up my mother. They said my step-father might yell at my mother "Why is our neighbor obsessed with you? Did you have sex with him? How many years have you been cheating on me?" So that's why my family never tells me anything, they keep secrets from me.</p>
