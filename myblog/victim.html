<h1>I Was Almost Raped</h1>
<p>I was a High Schooler at a public park smoking marijuna with my friend. My friend said to me "Is it okay if I bring another friend?" I replied "Go ahead." His friend was a latino adult man. The latino adult man asked me "Can you please sell me some of your marijuana?" I replied "Alright." The latino man snatched my bag of marijuana and walked away with it while telling me "Follow me, there might be cops watching us here." I followed him. I watched him turn a corner. He dissapeared. When I reached the corner, suddenly I was surrounded by a group of latino teenagers, their heads were shaved, they wore oversized white t shirts. I recognized one teenager was a latino peer from my High School, and it made me feel safe. Suddenly the latino adult man said "Go in there," I looked at where he pointed, and it was the park's public restroom. Suddenly, I realized what might happen if I went in the bathroom. I replied "No way dude, I am leaving." But it was too late. The latino adult man grabbed my shirt, punched my face several times, and creepily told me "You don't even want to know what I was gonna to do to you." The other teenagers each punched me too. One teenager brandished a knife, and that is why I did not use my skateboard as a weapon, and instead I skated away. As I was skating away, a low rider vehicle began revving its engine very loudly on the public road. The latino low riders witnessed my assault, and the violence made them excited. I felt like the low riders were following me. So I skated to the nearest fast food restaurant instead of going home. As I was eating, I kept thinking about what the latino adult man said to me "You don't even want to know what I was gonna do to you." It means he was going to rape me. After that, everywhere I visited, I kept seeing the latino adult man, not in reality, but in my imagination. Every face I witnessed, it was the same latino adult man's sweaty beady eyes. Suddenly, every human I encountered was potentionally a threat. Do you want to know what a rapist looks like? I saw his eyes. A rapist looks like a normal person. It could be your friend, cousin, parent, celebrity, stranger, significant other. A rapist could be literally anyone.</p>

<h1>Police Encounter<h1>
<p>I was homeless. I was walking a long distance. It was very sunny, so I stopped for a few seconds outside a barber shop which had excellent shade from the sun. Suddenly, an obese black woman with tattoos grabbed me from my backpack, I almost fell. I tried to remove my backpack, but instead I was being pulled in an alley next to the barber shop. The woman yelled "Ayy I caught this man trying to steal from your truck!" A black man stepped out of the barber shop, and the woman dragged me to the black man's truck. The black man said "Nothing is missing from my truck." And they walked away. I followed them. I said "I am sorry about this confusion." The black woman said "Get the fuck out of here." Suddenly, I was surrounded by a group of tall muscular angry black men who were trying to enter the barber shop. One black man asked "Is this man bothering you?" The black woman replied "He was trying to steal from the barber's truck." Suddenly, all the black men started arguing with each other, and then they all turned against me, one black man yelled at me "If I see you out here, I am serious, I'm going to curb stomp you." The other black man replied "we're going to break your jaw." I replied "The woman has my backpack." The black woman yelled "Ayy his backpack." The black barber threw my backpack at the floor. The other black man kicked my backpack. I picked up my backpack, and walked away angrily. I called the cops, and as I explained my story I started crying. When the police arrived. I did a terrible job of explaining my story, I was focused on the unimportant details, my story seemed unworthy of the police officer's time. Suddenly, the black barber stepped out and on instinct I pointed and exclaimed "That's him!" As if I was pointing at the messiah. Suddenly, I noticed a drastic change in the police officer's facial expression and body language. It was as if the police officers said to themselves "Ah I get it now, it was niggers the whole time." The police were on high alert. The black barber has one sciccors in his own hand. The police officer's left hand was on the gun holster, but his right hand was grabbing the sciccors from the black barber. I don't know what the black barber was saying but it looked like he was telling the police officer "Mr. Officer, I was just out here doing my job when that homeless schitzo tried to steal from my truck. I'm an honest hard working tax paying bussiness owner trying to defend my property." The police officer who spoke with the black barber returned to me and the police officer literally told me "Get the fuck out of here. Look at you. You're not all there. You're missing a couple screws. If I saw you standing next to MY truck, I would blow your brain out too with my gun." The police officer gestured an imaginary gun at me. I instinctively put my hand in my pocket. And the other police officer instinctively grabbed my arm and told "Sorry man it's just instinct. I know you won't do anything. Just get out of here." I replied "But they threatened to kill me. I walk down this street all the time." The second police told me "Don't walk down this street anymore unless you want to get killed. Take another route."</p>

<h1>Oppossing Black Lives Matter</h1>
<p>So that is why I don't support Black Lives Matter. Because I keep hearing stories about mexicans raping other mexicans. And I keep hearing "It's because mexicans are oppressed. White supremacy is the problem." What the fuck does white supremacy have to do with rape? I am sick and tired of hearing "the cops killed an innocent person." According to RAINN, 97.5% of sexual assaulters never go to prison for sexual assault, 96.7% of physical assaulters never go to prison for physical assault. There are more rapists in the free world than rapists in actual prison. And yet every rape story I am hearing always ends with "The mexican rapist ran away to mexico, we never seen or heard from them ever again," or "The mexican rapist never went to prison for rape, but he instead went to prison for minor drug offenses. After prison, he ran away to mexico, we never seen or heard from them ever again." There is a reason why they run away to mexico. When Donald Trump said “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” That's exactly what I believe. My name is Jovanny Rodriguez, I am mexican-american.</p>

<h1>More Rape Stories</h1>
<p>When I was a teenager, at a kick-back with underaged drinking and marijuana, a latina woman told me "You gotta meet my friend, he's so cool man. My friend is legitimately the second coming of Jesus Christ. At first I didn't believe. But then he started reading my thoughts word for word. This is crazy, you gotta meet him." The latina woman's prophet friend was a latino man. The latina woman left me alone with the latino man. The latino man showed me his penis and told me "Suck it." I replied "No way dude, I am leaving." I was drunk, so my entire consciousness was spinning. I struggled to stand up. The latino man told me "Where you headed homie?" I replied "Far away from here." The latino man replied "Sorry, I thought you were gay. I will find something to fuck today, a n-word, a trannie, or a stray cat." The latino man was laughing at the idea of raping an innocent stray cat. And something tells me he was not joking like he has done that before. I woke up at my house. I didn't look for signs of rape. I doubt that I was sexually assaulted, but I guess I'll never know.</p>

<p>When I was a teenager, at a kick-back with underaged drinking and marijuana, a mother announced "It's late, everyone has to leave now." One latina woman was so drunk, she was practically unconscious. A drunk adult latino man announced "What should we do with her?" A drunk latino teenager replied "She can stay here." The mother replied "Hell, no! Find out where she lives and take her home." The teenager replied "But mom please!" The mother replied "This party is over," and she walked away. Suddenly, it got awkward and quiet as everyone realized what just happened. What happened is the latino teenager basically asked his mother for permission to rape that unconscious latina woman. So we figured out where the unconscious latina woman lived, and we drove to her apartment. We were drunk driving on the freeway, I was a passenger in the backseat. I literally could have died that day. The unconscious latina woman vomitted in the car. When we got to the apartment, one adult latino man carried the unconscious latina woman to her apartment bedroom. When he returned, one latino adult replied "Ayy what took you so long homie? wink, wink." He replied "Don't even joke about that. She is like a sister to me."</p>

<p>When I was a young adult, I saw an old High School friend at a store. I started talking to him. He introduced me to his latino neighbor. The latino neighbor informed me "If a girl dresses like a whore for a party, that means she is horny and she wants sex. Nearly all my bro friends have had sex with an unconscious woman before. Why am I going to report them to the police? If you did not try to fuck an unconscious woman, that means you're gay." The latino neighbor continued "I was addicted to methamphetamine, but I quit it. Now I only smoke marijuana. Did you know that meth opens your mind to another realm, it heightens your perception. I swear to you. When I did meth I could hear everything. I could hear my neighbors having sex. Meth heightens your senses. If you do too much, you start to hear demons. So that is what happened to me. I started fighting demons. So I built a bomb, and I got arrested for it. It was a small bomb, it would obliberate up one entire room straight through brick." I replied "That doesn't sound like a small bomb." He replied "Yeah, man it's easy to build a bomb, you can go on youtube and search it up on google. The main ingredient is fertilizer, like the stuff from Home Depot." I replied "How did the police find you?" He replied "I was telling everyone that I was building a bomb, everyone knew, my parents, my friends. And I think the people at Home Depot knew about it too. I think all the Home Depot employees know that fertilizer is used for bombs." My latino friend replied "And my other homie from a gang taught us how to make methamphetamine with sudafed, we used to rob CVS stores." I did not believe him, but many years later I was listening to a "It Could Happen Here" podcast and the Robert Evans said the first ingredient to make a bomb is fertilizer, and that's when I knew it was probably true.</p>

<p>So I asked myself "This dude literally made a bomb in his own house? Why was it not on the news?" The best answer I came up with is because he is mexican. Literally, I would hear crazy stories about my ghetto neighborhood and it would never leave the local news. A latino man in my neighborhood killed his whole family and killed himself with a shotgun. No national press coverage. My own sister said "My latina friend was recently murdered by her latino exboyfriend. Her latino exboyfriend was just released out of prison. She was pregnant and had a new boyfriend. The latino exboyfriend murdered his own bestfriend cause he was a witness." No national press coverage.</p>

<p>

<p>My Black Lives Matter latino uncle hosted a party at his own house. During the party, a latino friend of the family sneaked himself into my latino cousin's bedroom. My cousin told me "He went in my bedroom, he was very drunk, he asked me if I was gay, and then he touched me." My cousin was 17 years old. I don't know specifically what happened. But the latino friend of the family was arrested, he spent a couple weeks in jail, and was let go.</p>

<p>My own mother said to me "A friend of the family visited a public park, their child went to the public restroom by himself. And then a latino gang leader raped the child."</p>
