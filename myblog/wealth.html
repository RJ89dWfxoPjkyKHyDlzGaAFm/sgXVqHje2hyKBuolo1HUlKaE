<p>According to 2020 Global Wealth Report <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/global-wealth-report.html">1</a>,</span> if your net worth is $10,000, you are wealthier than 55% of adults on Earth. If you take all the wealth on Earth and divide it evenly, each adult would have a net worth of $79,952. If your net worth is higher than $79,952, you are oppressing someone else. "Tax the Rich" means taxing anyone whose net worth is higher than $79,952.<br><br>All the possible money on Earth is $418.3 trillion. The wealthiest 1.1% of adults on Earth have a combined wealth of $191.6 trillion. According to Forbes <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210101033819/https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/">2</a>,</span> the combined wealth of only billionaires during 2020 was $8 trillion. Therefore, millionaires collectively own $183.6 trillion (191.6 minus 8). Millionaires own more money than billionaires simply because billionaires are rare and millionaires are very common. There are 56.1 million millionaires worldwide, and 2,095 billionaires. Billionaires own 1.9% (8/418.3) of the world's wealth. Millionaires own 43.8% (183.6/418.3) of the world's wealth.<img src="images\onepercent.webp"></p>

<p>Ethan Klein has a net worth of $20 million. 2,260,720+215,030=X and X/5.233-billion. Therefore, Ethan Klein is richer than 99.95% of adults. On page 15 of the 2020 Global Wealth Report it says "For convenience, we disregard the relatively small amount of wealth owned by children on their own account, and frame our results in terms of the global adult population, which totaled 5.233 billion in 2020." If I count the starving children in africa <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=2020+world+population">1</a>,</span> Ethan Klein is richer than 99.96% of all humans on Earth.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chtbl.com/track/289382/traffic.megaphone.fm/ROOSTER7186115382.mp3?updated=1626377407#t=3670,3720" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chtbl.com/track/289382/traffic.megaphone.fm/ROOSTER7186115382.mp3?updated=1626377407#t=3612,3650" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></span><br>This explains why Ethan hates billionaires. The more he hates billionaires, the poorer Ethan appears, and the less likely we are to notice how Ethan is ultra mega wealthy. Not only is Ethan in the one percent. He is almost one percent of the one percent.</p>
