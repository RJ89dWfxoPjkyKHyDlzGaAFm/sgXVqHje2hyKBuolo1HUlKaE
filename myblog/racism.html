<p>On this page I attempt to convince you that Black Lives Matter and White Nationalism are sex cults. Black Lives Matter seeks to overthrow the white patriarchy, to replace it with the black partiarchy.<p>

<p>In 1952, Malcolm X's rhetoric was founded upon the Nation of Islam. In 1964, Malcolm X realized the Nation of Islam was literally a religious sex cult, he was disillusioned, and so he quit being a Black Lives Matter leader. Malcolm X said "The real reason that I am out of the Black Muslim movement, which I never told, I kept to myself, but the real reason is Elijah Muhammad, the head of the movement, is the father of eight children by six different teenage girls who were his private personal secretary. <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.smithsonianchannel.com/video/series/the-lost-tapes/59950">1</a>"</span>

<p>In 1961, Paul Schäfer started his own White Nationalist germanic-nordic utopia colony named Colonia Dignidad. It slowly devolved into a religious sex cult where Paul Schäfer molested 200 boys. Paul Schäfer was found guilty, served 5 years in prison, and died of old age in prison. A movie was made about it with Emma Watson titled Colonia <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/UBSMl343fsw">2</a>.</span></p>

<p>There is a video of Donald Trump saying disgusting things about women, he said "Grab 'em by the pussy."</p>

<p>There is an audio recording of Martin Luther King saying disgusting things about women. Due to legal reasons, only Martin Luther King's wife has heard the audio recordings, and she described it as "It was a social event with people laughing and telling dirty jokes. But I did not hear Martin's voice on it, and there was nothing about sex." She heard "dirty jokes" but "nothing about sex," those are contradictory statements. She is in denial. There is so much evidence suggesting that Martin cheated on his wife, multiple credible allegations. Martin's wife said "all that other business just doesn't have a place in the very high-level relationship we enjoyed," which can be interpreted as "Martin and I were in love beyond the physical realm like no other woman could replicate. Martin never loved those other women, it was purely physical for him." Martin's bestfriend Ralph Abernathy said something you just gotta read it yourselves. I will paraphrase it, it's like he basically said "We were miles away from our wives, of course we planned to have extra-marital sex, us men have sexual needs, it's not our fault. But I ain't gonna be a snitch. I'll just say this, women were obsessed with Martin Luther King Jr, they were all over him. I ain't gonna be a snitch, use your imagination." The Black Lives Matter started harrassing Ralph Abernathy for tarnishing Martin's reputation, so Ralph Abernathy changed his statement to "I didn't ever say that he had sex with anybody," if you read the rest it can be interpreted as "Well I never actually saw him naked having sex... but it was so obvious, everyone knew he was having sex with those women... Fuck this shit, I shouldn't have spoken. Please ignore my previous statements. I now believe Martin was the nicest perfect human in the world who would never cheat. When I wrote my book, I was trying to be as honest as possible in the name of God, I didn't think about the consequences. I should have picked my words more wisely."</p>

<p>When Black Lives Matter or White Nationalism gets what it wants, it won't effect women's right, in the eyes of men, all women are worthless sex objects no matter which side of politics you choose.</p> 

<h1>Absence of Father</h1>
<p>Before you cancel me, here is a great African-American Youtuber named Larry Elder <a href="https://www.prageru.com/video/black-fathers-matter/">1</a>, who provides excellent commentary against the Black Lives Matter Movement. Larry Elder believes the greatest issue plaguing black communities is not systemic racism, rather the greatest issue is the absence of black fathers. Let's examine this hypothesis.</p>

<h1>Spurious Correlation</h1>
<p>One famous example of a spurious correlation is the statement "As ice cream consumption increases, the rate of drowning deaths along increases." Ice cream is not the direct cause of drowning, however, ice cream is usually present during many drownings because people consume ice cream during the summer, and during the summer people are more often swimming, and when people are swimming, they are more likely to drown. That is the spurious correlation between eating ice cream, and drowning deaths. Absence of black fathers is not the direct cause of poverty/crime, however, absence of black fathers is usually present during the lives of many black criminals. Whenever parents separate, there is something about that separation which negatively effects the offspring. For example, 23.5% of divorcees cited domestic violence as one cause for their separation <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4012696/">1</a>, 57.7% cited "too much conflict and arguing." Perhaps, black children are exposed to domestic violence and conflicts in the home, perhaps that explains why black teenagers end up in prison.</p>

<h1>Genetics</h1>
<p>The average Latino is 65.1% European, 18.0% Native American, and 6.2% African <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.11.010">1</a>. Latinos contain so much European DNA, that the FBI categorizes Mexicans as a <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/@@dvpdffiles/a/2/a2b2c0267dcd4a7ba6c2eef502413bdf/normal/dump_1.gif">1</a> White race of Mexican nationality.</p>

<p>The average African-American is 73.2% African, 24% European, and 0.8% Native American <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/12/genetic-study-reveals-surprising-ancestry-many-americans">1</a>. The majority of African-Americans have atleast one European grandparent. This effect is called miscegenation.</p>

<p>During Nazi Germany, people with atleast one Jewish grandparent were categorized as mischlinges <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mischlinge">1</a>. Logan Paul and Jake Paul are objective examples of mischlinges <a href="https://youtu.be/vUAfl-h5fkc?t=205">1</a>.</p>

<p>Barack Obama's mother is white. Trevor Noah's father is white. Colin Kaepernick's mother is white. Jordan Peele's mother is white. Keegan-Michael Key's mother is white.</p>

<p>Every Black History month you encounter this list of famous black inventors <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/dc/d8/5cdcd85edc11fe6a80b35699f6cf191a.png">1</a>. The vast majority of black inventors are mischlinges of white ancestry. It's the sad truth we all must accept, african-americans owe their intelligence to being a crossbreed with Europeans. There is no correlation of intelligence with morality. Whites are smarter, this does not make whites less dangerous. Blacks are dumber, this does not make blacks more dangerous. Both whites and blacks are equally dangerous. For example, Edward D. Breen is a white man and CEO of DuPont. On August 2001, DuPont was exposed for having dumped a then obscure chemical PFOA into a lake in Washington, USA. The lawsuit revealed, DuPont in the 1960s had conducted private research which proved PFOA causes an englarged liver in rats, rabbits, and dogs; DuPont was aware that PFOA accumulates in the body resisting bio-degradation. In the 1970s, DuPont discovered it's factory workers had high blood levels of PFOA. In the 1980s, DuPont proved PFOA causes birth effects in rats, then Dupont discovered two of it's pregnant factory workers gave birth to defective human offspring. In the 1990s, DuPont had knowledge that it's local water supply was contaminated with PFOA, factory workers and citizens near the factory were being diagnosed cancer because of PFOA. To summarize, over 4 decades DuPont had knowledge that PFOA is extremely toxic to humans, Dupont conspired to hide this evidence from the public, DuPont chose profits over the health of humans. Now, today 98% of all humans in the United States have detectable blood levels of PFOA <a href="https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.10598">1</a>.</p>

<h1>Alfred Sharpton</h1>
<p>Alfred Sharpton lived with his single mother in a ghetto neighborhood <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAzoxvJCEKE">1</a>, meanwhile, Alfred Sharpton's father lived in a wealthy neighborhood. Alfred Sharpton's father was a slumlord who took advantange of poor black people <a href="https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/politics/national/2004race/5570/">2</a>. Alfred Sharpton's father created a Woody Allen situation by marrying Alfred Sharpton's step sister <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edVSQkAN_hw">3</a>. Alfred Sharpton spent his entire life searching for a father figure, he thought he found one in James Brown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAzoxvJCEKE">4</a>. Don't you think that's sad? The only father figure he had turned out to be a literal psychopath who abuses women. James Brown was arrested for assaulting his wife with a lead pipe, and firing a gun at a car that she was in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQmqcaS5LIM">5</a>.</p>

<h1>Value of Money</h1>
<p>A long time ago, a man learned that money and power attracts women; directly or indirectly. Ever since then, men have been obsessed with money and material objects. Without money, men feel hideous and ugly. When a man believes he is ugly, it makes his penis limp. When a man has verified symbols on social media, it allows him to message any woman he wants. Men don't want average women. Men want beautiful instagram models.</p> 

<p>El Chapo Guzman utilized all his wealth and power to invite his celebrity crush Kate Del Castillo into his home, and it actually worked <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/el-chapo-speaks-40784/">1</a>.</p>

<p>Scientists said violence occurs whenever low income men feel sexually insecure about their small bank account, so low income men overcompensate through acting extra tough and masculine <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0305-750X(00)00122-4">3</a>.</p>

<p>Mohammed Bello's wealth allowed him to house and feed each of his 86 wives and 150 offsprings <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwM1ncuYAAg">1</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVhJFM1bsJ0">2</a>.</p>

<p>White men and Black men are fighting to control the world's money. If you control the money, you control women and sex. I know this sound crazy, but just look at the evidence. In 319 years, Humans went from a population of 600 million to 7.7 billion <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/11/Annual-World-Population-since-10-thousand-BCE-for-OWID.png">3</a>. Before that it took 11,700 years to reach 600 million. And before that it took 287,982 years to reach 4 million. Sex is a major influence of how our society is structured today. Sex is so important, in fact, since you are reading this, there is a very high chance you are alive because of sex. Sex that your parents had.</p>

<p>Of course, not all men are like this. However, it only takes one crazy person to wreak havoc on Earth. The September 11 attacks, it only took 5 people to murder 2,977 innocent civilians. The 2017 Las Vegas Shooting, it only took one person to injure 411 innocent civilians and murder 60 innocent civilians. The richest 1% own 44% of the world's wealth <a href="https://inequality.org/facts/global-inequality/">1</a>. And who are the 1% percent? Men. In the Unites States, the richest 1% is almost entirely composed of men. Specifically, 95.5% of the richest 1% are men <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1536504220902196">2</a>. And examining Forbes' list of the richest women in the world <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinstoller/2020/04/07/the-top-10-richest-women-in-the-world-2020/">3</a>., you will notice 100% of the top 10 richest women in the world are not self made billionaires. The vast majority of the time when a woman is a billionaire it's because that woman inherited a wealth or business from a husband or a father.</p>

<h1>Greed of Slavery</h1>
<p>The truth of why White men purchased slaves, and why Black men sold slaves. Because every man has a sexual fantasy in their mind. This sexual fantasy involves purchasing a big house with luxuries because it attracts pornstars to have sex with. White men and Black men will do anything to accomplish this sexual fantasy, including purchasing and selling slaves.</p>

<p>A journalist named Michael Scott Moore was kidnapped by Somali pirates, he was captive as ransom for 2 years. While the average Somali citizen earned less than one dollar per day, Michael Moore observed Somali gangmembers owned fancy cars and mansions. One Somali gangmember bragged how every bullet on their belt cost one dollar each. Some joined gangs to avoid poverty, but Michael Moore observed the vast majority joined gangs because of greed. -18:15 <a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/2FgoWxcdaVqfcGm77CXlNc">3</a></p>

<h1>African Men Sold Their Own</h1>
<p>"The historians John Thornton and Linda Heywood of Boston University estimate that 90 percent of those shipped to the New World were enslaved by Africans and then sold to European traders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html">3</a>."</p>

<p>Nat Amarteifio is an African who said "The Europeans weren’t going out and capturing Africans. They couldn’t — they got sick and died from illnesses like malaria <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-08-20/willful-amnesia-how-africans-forgot-and-remembered-their-role-slave-trade">2</a>."</p> 

<p>24% of Nigerians possess the Sickle Cell trait <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/20890">1</a>. Sickle Cell trait provides 60% immunity against malaria <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/biology/index.html#tabs-1-4">2</a>. Millions of Africans possess 100% immunity against malaria, from being repeatedly exposed to it <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1128%2FCMR.00025-08">3</a>.</p>

<p>Africans sold slaves and killed elephants. According to Smithsonian, Africans have killed elephants since atleast 1400CE <a href="https://africa.si.edu/collection/conservation/protect-ivory/">1</a>. In 1800CE there were 26 million elephants in Africa <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/media/history-ivory-trade/">2</a>. In 1979CE there were only 600,000 elephants. The purpose of killing elephants is to collect ivory tusk. Adam Ruins Everything is one of the most progressive liberal television shows on the internet. Adam Ruins Everything criticises police brutality, and the Amerian prison system. However, even Adam Ruins Everything says that white people killing animals for trophy hunting is a minor issue compared to the systemic killings Africans do to collect ivory tusk <a href=" https://youtu.be/YUA8i5S0YMU?t=65">3</a>. Africans sell ivory tusk to whites and chinese people, because some believe ivory tusk cures erectile dysfuntion. That is why in America you find these erectile dysfuntion pills everywhere called Rhino <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/108844/download">4</a>, it does not contain real ivory tusk, but everyone knows rhinos symbolizes virility. White men purchase ivory to cure erectile dysfunction, and African men sell ivory for the purpose of affording a big house and luxuries because it attracts pornstars to have sex with. And rhinos die because of it.</p>

<h1>Black Women</h1>
<p>"United States Sentencing Commission," says black women receive 29.7% SHORTER prison sentences than white men <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/demographic-differences-sentencing">1</a>.</p>

<p>"Mapping Police Violence," says 96.2% of african-americans killed by police are male victims <a href="../mappingpoliceviolence.html">1</a>.</p>

<p>32.2% of black men, 5.9% of white men, 5.6% of black women, and 0.9% of white women will be imprisoned <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lifetime-likelihood-by-race.png">5</a> <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=836">6</a>. Black women were slaves too, and yet Black women perpetrate fewer crime than Black men and White men. The crime statistics suggests every man on Earth is a potential threat <a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*tF8MqygzkichswdWkK8nSA.png">6</a>.</p>

<p>Oluwatoyin Salau was an ardent supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5UsGk0GDRs">1</a>. In the end, Oluwatoyin Salau was raped and murdered by a black man named Aaron Glee Jr. Oluwatoyin Salau was murdered by the same black men whom she was trying to help.</p> 

<h1>White Women</h1>
<p>White men invented slavery and then forced White women to accept it. Until 1920, White women were forbidden from politics. This viral video shows a white woman doing a false police report against a black man. We called this White woman a murderer. But how are white women murderers, when it is always a white man pulling the trigger? 87.2% of police officers are male <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/tables/table-74">4</a>. What is White Privilege worth for women when all women afraid of being killed and raped. Women are not allowed to leave their homes.</p>

<p>White women owned slaves, but her slaves were often gifts that white men offered <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/10/25/white-women-slaveholders-q-a/">3</a>.</p>

<h1>Afrocentrism</h1>
<p>A common afrocentric argument of how Europe ostensibly destroyed Africa. "Africa's primitive state gave Europeans the economic advantage. European merchants offered cheaper prices than African merchants, so African businesses failed. This put Africa in debt, and the only option Africa had to pay their debt was selling slaves. Africa would be advanced if Europe had left Africa alone."

<p>John Thornton debunked the aforementioned theory <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL454363W/Africa_and_Africans_in_the_making_of_the_Atlantic_world_1400-1680?edition=isbn_9780521398640">4</a>. Africans rarely purchased essential items from the Europeans, instead the Africans purchased nonessential "novelty items" such as metal knives, beads, mirrors, rum, and guns. In other words, African men sold slaves because of greed. According to John Thornton page 52, the historian Ray A. Kea compiled a list of the top 150 popular items in the Gold Coast that Africans purchased from Europeans, 47 out of 150 were items of clothing. Africans produced their own luxury clothing, and clothing was so afforable that even peasants owned clothes, but nobody wanted to dress like a peasant. Perhaps one reason why Africans spent so much money on clothes, John Thornton noted, is because Africans did not pay rent. African cultures simply did not have any concept of buying and selling territories.</p> 

<p>Great Britain imported 3,259,440 african slaves. The USA imported 305,326 african slaves. It's safe to say, Africans purchased clothing that was manufactured by african slaves.</p>

<p>Nike products are manufactured by sweatshops workers who were paid 15 cents per hour during 1997, and 89 cents per hour during 2003 <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nike-workers-pay-kaepernick/">1</a>. Adidas products are also manufactured in sweatshops.</p>

<p>The "woke" football player Cam Newton said "I've spent thousands and thousands of dollars, and maybe even millions of dollars on clothes that I only wore once <a href="https://youtu.be/RVVEtORhT-4?t=185">1</a>." Wearing the same outfit more than once, Cam Newton calls it "recyling." Cam Newton said his New Years Resolution is to not buy high fashion. 88% of New Year's resolutions fail. The "woke" musician Drake spent $976,000 on one outfit <a href="https://youtu.be/7pWCYUiU7zM?t=251">2</a>. The "woke" Lil Uzi Vert spent $24 million on one diamond on his forhead <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVIm3kvZcM8">3</a>. While these "woke" celebrities are worried about their outfits, meanwhile 2 billion humans on Earth don't have access to safe drinking water <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/drinking-water">4</a>.</p> 

<p>In 2020, some Indians boycotted Jeff Bezos, because Amazon.com's cheap prices allegedly caused Indian businesses to fail <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51117315">4</a>.</p> 

<p>Another common afrocentric argument is "Africans were unaware of slavery abuses in the New World. Africans owned slaves, but loved their slaves like a family. Meanwhile, Europeans tortured their slaves."</p>

<h1>Invention of Slavery</h1>
<p>The idea of slavery started when humans were hunting and gathering. It started with an inspiration like "What if I could hit someone on their head, and force them to bring me food?" During hunter gatherer times, real slavery did not exist, because your slaves easily escaped.</p>
<p>Real slavery started around 10,000BCE during the agricultural revolution. During agriculture times, your slaves did not easily escape, because the only alternative of being a slave was being a hunter gatherer. Ancient people on different continents independently discovered and practiced slavery. "Code of Hammurabi" details slavery in ancient Mesopotamia from 1,754BCE <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/slavery-sociology/The-law-of-slavery">3</a>. "Laws of Manu" details slavery in ancient India from 100BCE. "Tang Code" details slavery in ancient China from 624CE. "Quran" details slavery in ancient Middle East from 632CE.</p>

<h1>Education</h1>
<p>Stop saying that poverty causes crime. To say that poverty causes crime is like saying absence of sex causes rape. Seriously? How many years of college education will it take to learn that killing and raping is wrong?</p>

<p>During 2019, 110,812 female college students participated in this survey <a href="https://www.aau.edu/key-issues/campus-climate-and-safety/aau-campus-climate-survey-2019">1</a>. 24% of verbal sexual harassment against female graduate students was perpetrated by college employees; such as a teacher, advisor, faculty, coach, trainer, etc. Depending on how rape is defined, 10.9% to 16.2% of female college students experienced a completed or an attempted rape. 73.3% of female college students said their rapist was a fellow college student.</p>

<p>How is college supposed to fix society, when the college employees themselves are the ones perpetrating sexual harassment? According to Global Study on Homicide, 34% of murdered women were murdered by their intimate partner, and "Men who kill their intimate partners have a markedly different profile to men who kill outside relationships, according to studies from several European countries. They tend to have better jobs and enjoy a higher standard of living than other perpetrators, and often have no criminal background. One study found that men who killed their partners were better educated than other homicide perpetrators and had fewer gaps in their employment history <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/global-study-on-homicide.html">1</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1077801204265015">2</a>."</p>

<h1>Domestic Violence</h1>
<p>During 1995 to 1996, 8,000 women participated in a telephone survey <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/app/publications/abstract.aspx?id=172837">5</a>. It observed that 14.8% of women were victims of a completed rape, 2.8% of women were victims of an attempted rape. 22.1% of women were victims of a physical assault from an intimate partner. 8% of women had felt terrorized by a stalker. </p>

<p>During 2015, 5,758 women participated in a telephone survey <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nisvs/summaryreports.html">6</a>. It was learned that 21.3% of women were victims of either a completed or an attempted rape. 16% of women had felt terrorized by stalkers. 37% of women were victims of an unwanted sexual contact.</p>
