<p>Here I want to convince us that the Black Lives Matter movement is a toxic black men's rights movement. Its ultimate purpose is to overthrow the white patriarchy and replace it with a black partriarchy.</p>

<h1>Evolutionary Psychology</h1>
<p>Scientists in 2018 reported the first Homo Sapiens existed 300,000 years ago <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2018.05.005">[1]</a>. The agricultural revolution began around 10,000BCE. 300,000-12,018=287,982 and 287,982÷300,000=96%. 96% of Homo Sapien history was hunting and gathering. In other words, 96% of our brain believes we are a hunter gatherer. This explains why humans today are like savages. 4% of our brain fights against the other 96% of our brain.</p>

<h1>Value of Money</h1>
<p>All things that men do, it is to attract women. The clothes he wears, the car he drives, his mannerism. It all depends on the type of woman he desires. A long time ago, a man learned that money and power attracts women. Ever since then, men have become obsessed with money and material objects. Without money, men feel hideous and ugly. When a man believes he is ugly, it makes his penis limp. If a man has verified symbols on social media, it allows him to message any woman he wants. El Chapo Guzman understood the value of money. That was why during 2015, El Chapo Guzman utilized all his wealth and power to invite his celebrity crush Kate Del Castillo into his home, and it actually worked <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/el-chapo-speaks-40784/">[1]</a>. Men don't want average women. Men want beautiful instagram models.</p>

<p>A long timo ago, a man learned a new method for attracting women, which is to make other men be poorer than you. That is why men are always bullying and fighting, because the penis experiences erectile dysfunction from knowing other men are wealthier. White men and Black men are fighting to control the world's money. If you control the money, you control women. You don't believe in this conspiracy theory? Mohammed Bello's wealth allowed him to house and feed each of his 86 wives and 150 offsprings <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwM1ncuYAAg">[1]</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVhJFM1bsJ0">[2]</a>. Low income men preached for violence against Mohammed Bello. Scientists did say that violence persists because low income men feel insecure from having no money to attract women, so our low income men overcompensate by acting extra tough and masculine <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0305-750X(00)00122-4">[3]</a>.</p>

<h1>Greed of Slavery</h1>
<p>The truth of why White men purchased slaves, and why Black men sold slaves. Basically, every man has a sexual fantasy in their mind. The goal of average men is they are to purchase a big house and expensive luxuries because it attracts sexy women to have sex with. White men and Black men will do anything to accomplish that sexual fantasy, including selling and buying slaves. You don't believe in this theory? DJ Khaled explains why he doesn't perform cunnilingus on his wife <a href="https://youtu.be/W87MssOF7nY?t=453">[1]</a>, spoiler, the purpose of marriage is husbands generate money, and wives become a stay-at-home sex object.</p>


<h1>African Men Sold Their Own</h1>

<p>"The historians John Thornton and Linda Heywood of Boston University estimate that 90 percent of those shipped to the New World were enslaved by Africans and then sold to European traders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html">[3]</a>."</p>

<p>Nat Amarteifio says "The Europeans weren’t going out and capturing Africans. They couldn’t — they got sick and died from illnesses like malaria <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-08-20/willful-amnesia-how-africans-forgot-and-remembered-their-role-slave-trade">[2]</a>."</p> 

<p>25% of Nigerians possess the Sickle Cell trait <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1989.tb24159.x">[1]</a>. Sickle Cell trait provides 60% immunity against malaria <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/biology/index.html#tabs-1-4">[2]</a>. Millions of Africans have 100% immunity against malaria, from being repeatedly exposed to it <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1128%2FCMR.00025-08">[3]</a>.</p>

<h1>Black Women</h1>
<p>You are a Black woman. You suffered worse than any man in history. You worked in cotton fields while pregnant. White men dug holes the size of your pregnant stomach to fit in the ground as they flogged you. You deserve a movement of your own. #BlackLivesMatter is not doing enough to represent Black women.</p>

<p>"United States Sentencing Commission," says black women receive 29.7% SHORTER prison sentences than white men <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/demographic-differences-sentencing">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>"Mapping Police Violence," says 96.2% of african-americans killed by police are male victims <a href="../mappingpoliceviolence.html">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>32.2% of black men, 5.9% of white men, 5.6% of black women, and 0.9% of white women will be imprisoned <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lifetime-likelihood-by-race.png">[5]</a> <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=836">[6]</a>. Black women were slaves too, and yet Black women perpetrate fewer crime than Black men and White men. The crime statistics suggests every man on Earth is a potential threat <a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*tF8MqygzkichswdWkK8nSA.png">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>Oluwatoyin Salau was an ardent supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5UsGk0GDRs">[1]</a>. In the end, Oluwatoyin Salau was raped and murdered by a black man named Aaron Glee Jr. Oluwatoyin Salau was murdered by the same black people whom she was trying to help.</p> 

<h1>White Women</h1>
<p>White men invented slavery and then forced White women to accept it. Until 1920, White women were forbidden from politics. This viral video shows a white woman doing a false police report against a black man. We called this White woman a murderer. But how are white women murderers, when it is always a white man pulling the trigger? 87.2% of police officers are male <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/tables/table-74">[4]</a>. What is White Privilege worth for women when all women afraid of being killed and raped. Women are not allowed to leave their homes.</p>

<p>White women owned slaves, but her slaves were often gifts that white men offered <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/10/25/white-women-slaveholders-q-a/">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>Two examples of black men verbally bullying white women <a href="https://twitter.com/sreed101/status/1278572389144637440">[4]</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/wypipo_h8/status/1275228765941977089">[3]</a>.</p>

<h1>Afrocentrism</h1>
<p>A common afrocentric argument of how Europe ostensibly destroyed Africa. "Africa's primitive state gave Europeans the economic advantage. European merchants offered cheaper prices than African merchants, so African businesses failed. This put Africa in debt, and the only option Africa had to pay their debt was selling slaves. Africa would be advanced if Europe had left Africa alone."

<p>John Thornton disputes the aforementioned theory <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL454363W/Africa_and_Africans_in_the_making_of_the_Atlantic_world_1400-1680?edition=isbn_9780521398640">[4]</a>. Africans rarely purchased essential items from the Europeans, instead the Africans purchased nonessential "novelty items" such as metal knives, beads, mirrors, rum, and guns. In other words, African men sold slaves because of greed.</p>

<p>In 2020, some Indians boycotted Jeff Bezos, because Amazon.com's cheap prices caused Indian businesses to fail <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51117315">[4]</a>.</p> 

<p>A journalist named Michael Scott Moore was kidnapped by Somali pirates, he was captive as ransom for 2 years. While the average Somali citizen earned less than one dollar per day, Michael Moore observed Somali gangmembers owned fancy cars and mansions. One Somali gangmember bragged how every bullet on their belt cost one dollar each. Some joined gangs to avoid poverty, but Michael Moore observed the vast majority joined gangs because of greed. [-18:15] <a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/2FgoWxcdaVqfcGm77CXlNc">[3]</a></p>

<p>Another common afrocentric argument is "Africans were unaware of slavery abuses in the New World. Africans owned slaves, but loved their slaves like a family. Meanwhile, Europeans tortured their slaves."</p>

<h1>Invention of Slavery</h1>
<p>The idea of slavery started when humans were hunting and gathering. It started with an inspiration like "What if I could hit someone on their head, and force them to bring me food?" During hunter gatherer times, real slavery did not exist, because your slaves easily escaped.</p>
<p>Real slavery started around 10,000BCE when agriculture was invented. During agriculture times, your slaves did not easily escape, because the only alternative of being a slave was being a hunter gatherer. Ancient people on different continents independently discovered and practiced slavery. "Code of Hammurabi" details slavery in ancient Mesopotamia from 1,754BCE <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/slavery-sociology/The-law-of-slavery">[3]</a>. "Laws of Manu" details slavery in ancient India from 100BCE. "Tang Code" details slavery in ancient China from 624CE. "Quran" details slavery in ancient Middle East from 632CE.</p>

<p>During 2019, 110,812 female college students participated in this survey <a href="https://www.aau.edu/key-issues/campus-climate-and-safety/aau-campus-climate-survey-2019">[1]</a>. 24% of verbal sexual harassment against female graduate students was perpetrated by college employees; such as a teacher, advisor, faculty, coach, trainer, etc. Depending on how rape is defined, 10.9% to 16.2% of female college students experienced a completed or an attempted rape. 73.3% of female college students said their rapist was a fellow college student.</p>

<p>How is college supposed to fix society, when the college employees themselves are the ones perpetrating sexual harassment? According to Global Study on Homicide, 34% of murdered women are murdered by their intimate partner, and "Men who kill their intimate partners have a markedly different profile to men who kill outside relationships, according to studies from several European countries. They tend to have better jobs and enjoy a higher standard of living than other perpetrators, and often have no criminal background. One study found that men who killed their partners were better educated than other homicide perpetrators and had fewer gaps in their employment history <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/global-study-on-homicide.html">[1]</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1077801204265015">[2]</a>."</p>

<p>During 1995 to 1996, 8,000 women participated in a telephone survey <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/app/publications/abstract.aspx?id=172837">[5]</a>. It observed that 14.8% of women were victims of a completed rape, 2.8% of women were victims of an attempted rape. 22.1% of women were victims of a physical assault from an intimate partner. 8% of women had felt terrorized by a stalker. </p>

<p>Chuck Berry was arrested for punching some woman's face <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chuck-berry-farewell-to-the-father-of-rock-118589/">[12]</a>. Chuck Berry installed hidden cameras in the women's restroom of a restaurant that he owned. There was a video of Chuck Berry urinating on a woman, and the same woman defecating on Chuck Berry's face <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=akzvdiyCQ1EC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q&f=false">[13]</a>. Chuck Berry allegedly had sex with a 14 year old runaway prostitute named Janice Escalanti.</p>

<p>Ray Diaz was internet famous due to his appearances on Jake Paul's vlogs. Ray Diaz was arrested for doing sexual assault and domestic violence. Ray Diaz's known victims are <a href="https://www.instagram.com/landihicks/">Landi Hicks</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/angelicasalek/">Angelica Salek</a>. Below are audio recordings of Ray Diaz verbally tormenting his victims, some includes audio of Ray Diaz slapping women. The audio is disturbing, you should not listen to the audio if you believe you might experience PTSD or Vicarious Traumatization. The audio was from this youtube playlist <a href="raydiaz.html">[14]</a>. To be honest, I don't know if Ray Diaz was ever found guilty. All I know is that if you check Ray Diaz's instagram, he is not in jail or prison, he is plainly out here in the free world living his best life.</p>

<p>Lorena Bobbit is a latina woman, who suffered years of psychological trauma, physical assault, and rape from the perpetrator named John Bobbit. One evening, John Bobbit arrived home, consumed alcohol, raped Lorena Bobbit, and then John Bobbit fell asleep. With a kitchen knife Lorena Bobbit literally severed John Bobbit's penis. John Bobbit didn't feel it because he was unconscious from alcohol intoxication. Lorena Bobbit reported the incident to the police. John Bobbit was taken to a hospital where a doctor surgically reattached the penis together, and the penis healed and returned to functioning normally. When the police interrogated Lorena Bobbit, she replied "He always have orgasm [sic], and he doesn't wait for me ever to have orgasm. He's selfish." In court, this quote was shown as evidence that the sex was consentual. So John Bobbit was acquitted of rape. In 1994, John Bobbit physically assaulted a woman named Kristina Elliott. In 1999, John Bobbit  physically assaulted a woman named Joanna Ferrell.</p>
