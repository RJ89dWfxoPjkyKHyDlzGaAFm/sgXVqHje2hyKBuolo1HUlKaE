<p>Racism does not exist. Here's why.</p>

<p>"United States Sentencing Commission," it says Black females receive 29.7% SHORTER prison sentences than white males <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/demographic-differences-sentencing">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>"Mapping Police Violence," it says 96.2% of african-americans killed by police are male victims.</p>

<p>It is clear that mostly black men are being killed by cops. This means that cops are not racist, they are sexist. Black females receive shorter prison sentences than white males. In our justice system, this means black females have more privilege than white males.</p>

<p>This is my message to all black women. I hope you realize somehow that you are absolutely being brainwashed by the Black Lives Matter Movement. You are being taught to hate white people. It is proven that white females are the most statistically docile people on Earth <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lifetime-likelihood-by-race.png">[2]</a>. And yet the BLM teaches black women how to bully white women called "Karens."</p>

<p>The most famous Karen, a white woman who made a false police report on an innocent black man <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFjxye6T4fk">[3]</a>.</p> I understand this false police report could have resulted in the execution of this innocent black man. However, we must remember that the Karen herself does not physically pull the trigger. It is almost always a white MAN who kills the innocent black person. 87.2% of police officers are male <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/tables/table-74">[4]</a>. And we have already mentioned that worldwide 94% of convicted killers are male. The evidence is clear. White women are rarely killers.</p>

<p>The Black Lives Matter Movement is a lie. White women are not your enemies. White women are the victims too.</p>

<p>During 1995 to 1996, 8,000 women participated in a national random digit telephone survey <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/app/publications/abstract.aspx?id=172837">[5]</a>. It was learned that 14.8% of women were victims of a completed rape, 2.8% of women were victims of an attempted rape. 51.9% of women were victims of a physical assault such as slapped, hit, pushed, grabbed, shoved, etc. 22.1% of women were victims of a physical assault from an intimate partner. 8% of women were victims of stalkers. </p>

<p>During 2015, 5,758 women participated in a national random digit telephone survey <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nisvs/summaryreports.html">[6]</a>. It was learned that 21.3% of women were victims of either a completed or an attempted rape. 37% of women were victims of an unwanted sexual contact such as kissed, fondled, groped, grabbed, etc. 16% of women were victims of stalkers which made them feel very fearful, or believed that she or someone close to them would be harmed or killed.</p> 

<p>I interviewed men who have said "Women enjoy being abused and degraded. That's why the best selling women's book is Fifty Shades of Gray."</p>

<p>I interviewed men who have said "There are approximately 400,000 homicides per year. Even if men did all of it... That is still nothing compared to the atrocities that women do. For example, women induce 41.6 million abortions per year <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61575-X">[6]</a>. Abortion is murder."</p>

<p>I interviewed men who have said "Women lie, cheat, and make false police reports. You can never trust rape statistics. The other day I touched a woman's shoulder. I bet she told everyone it was sexual abuse."</p>

<p>With the story of Lorena Bobbit, let's examine why women do crimes. Lorena Bobbit is a latina woman, who suffered years of psychological trauma, physical assault, and rape from the perpetrator named John Bobbit. One evening, John Bobbit arrived home, consumed alcohol, raped Lorena Bobbit, and then John Bobbit fell asleep. Then, with a kitchen knife Lorena Bobbit literally severed John Bobbit's penis. John Bobbit didn't feel it because he was unconscious from alcohol intoxication. Lorena Bobbit reported the incident to the police. John Bobbit was taken to a hospital where a doctor surgically reattached the penis together, and the penis healed and returned to functioning normally. When the police interrogated Lorena Bobbit, she replied "He always have orgasm [sic], and he doesn't wait for me ever to have orgasm. He's selfish." In court, this quote was shown as evidence that the sex was consentual. So John Bobbit was acquitted. Less than a year later in 1994, John Bobbit physically assaulted a woman named Kristina Elliott; and so John Bobbit was in jail for 15 days. When John Bobbit was released from 15 days in jail, he became a successful porn star due to his unique "frankenpenis." In 1999, John Bobbit was on probation for theft. Finally, John Bobbit went to prison because he broke his probation by physically assaulting Joanna Ferrell.</p>

<p>In 2019, a judge asked a female rape victim if she had closed her legs <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-stirs-uproar-alleged-rape-victim-closed-legs/story?id=62185027">[7]</a>. During 2016, a video was published with a quote by Donald Trump "Grab 'em by the pussy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYqKx1GuZGg">[8]</a>." </p>

<p>Rodney King had children with 3 different women. All of Rodney King's marriages ended in divorce. During 1999, Rodney King was arrested for doing domestic violence <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-nov-30-me-king30-story.html">[9]</a>. On October 2003, Rodney King was arrested because he punched some woman in the stomach. During 2005, Rodney King was arrested for threatening to kill his wife, and threatening to kill one of his daughters.</p>

<p>Alton sterling had been arrested for domestic violence and he was a registered sex offender <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/alton-sterling-arrest-record/">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>George Floyd had been arrested for a robbery, in which George Floyd had pressed a pistol onto a woman's abdomen <a href="../georgefloyd.html">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>James Brown had been arrested for domestic violence, in which James Brown fired a gun at his wife, and assaulted her with a lead pipe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQmqcaS5LIM">[12]</a>.</p>

<p>Chuck Berry had been arrested for physical assault, in which Chuck Berry punched a woman's face <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chuck-berry-farewell-to-the-father-of-rock-118589/">[12]</a>. Chuck Berry owned a restaurant, in which Chuck Berry installed hidden cameras in the women's restroom. An investigation discovered a video of Chuck Berry having consensual sex with a woman, in which Chuck Berry urinated on the woman, and then the woman defecated on Chuck Berry's face <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=akzvdiyCQ1EC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q&f=false">[13]</a>. Chuck Berry allegedly had sex with a 14 year old runaway prostitute named Janice Escalanti. Chuck Berry's lyrics of "My Ding A Ling" is about masturbation. Chuck Berry's lyrics of "Sweet Little Sixteen" is about the age of consent. However, Chuck Berry claimed he was somehow a victim of a racist conspiracy.</p>

<p>Ray Diaz was internet famous due to his appearances on Jake Paul's vlogs. Ray Diaz was exposed and arrested for doing sexual assault and domestic violence. Ray Diaz's known victims are <a href="https://www.instagram.com/landihicks/">Landi Hicks</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/angelicasalek/">Angelica Salek</a>. Below are audio recordings of Ray Diaz verbally tormenting his victims, some includes audio of Ray Diaz slapping women. Do not listen if you believe you might experience either PTSD or Vicarious Traumatization. The audio is disturbing. I wanted to share this to educate others, and hopefully help others experience some revelation. I cropped the audio from this youtube playlist <a href="raydiaz.html">[14]</a>. To be honest, I don't know if Ray Diaz was ever found guilty. All I know is that if you check Ray Diaz's instagram, he is not in jail or prison, he is plainly out here in the free world living his best life.</p>
