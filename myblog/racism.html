<h1>Absence of Father</h1>
<p>Before you cancel me, here is a great African-American Youtuber named Larry Elder <a href="https://www.prageru.com/video/black-fathers-matter/">[1]</a>, who provides excellent commentary against the Black Lives Matter Movement. Larry Elder believes the greatest issue plaguing black communities is not systemic racism, rather the greatest issue is the absence of black fathers. Let's examine this hypothesis.</p>

<h1>Spurious Correlation</h1>
<p>There is a very strong spurious correlation betweeen absence of black fathers, and poverty/crime. One famous example of a spurious correlation is the statement "As ice cream consumption increases, the rate of drowning deaths along increases." Ice cream is not the direct cause of drowning, however, icecream is usually present during many drownings because people consume ice cream during the summer, and during the summer people are more often swimming, and when people are swimming, they are more likely to drown. That is the spurious correlation between eating ice cream, and drowning deaths. Absence of black fathers is not the direct cause of poverty/crime, however, absence of black fathers is usually present during the life of many black criminals. Whenever parents separate, there is something about that separation which negatively effects the offspring. For example, 23.5% of divorcees cited domestic violence as one cause for their separation <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4012696/">[1]</a>, 57.7% cited "too much conflict and arguing." Perhaps, black children are exposed to domestic violence and conflicts in the home, perhaps that explains why black teenagers end up in prison.</p>

<h1>Genetics</h1>
<p>The average Latino is 65.1% European, 18.0% Native American, and 6.2% African <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.11.010">[1]</a>. Latinos contain so much European DNA, that the FBI categorizes Mexicans as a <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/@@dvpdffiles/a/2/a2b2c0267dcd4a7ba6c2eef502413bdf/normal/dump_1.gif">[1]</a> White race of Mexican nationality.</p>

<p>The average African-American is 73.2% African, 24% European, and 0.8% Native American <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/12/genetic-study-reveals-surprising-ancestry-many-americans">[1]</a>. The majority of African-Americans have atleast one European grandparent. This effect is called miscegenation.</p>

<p>During Nazi Germany, people with atleast one Jewish grandparent were categorized as mischlinges <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mischlinge">[1]</a>. Logan Paul and Jake Paul are objective examples of mischlinges <a href="https://youtu.be/vUAfl-h5fkc?t=205">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Barack Obama's mother is white. Trevor Noah's father is white. Colin Kaepernick's mother is white. Jordan Peele's mother is white. Keegan-Michael Key's mother is white.</p>

<p>Every Black History month you encounter this list of famous black inventors <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/dc/d8/5cdcd85edc11fe6a80b35699f6cf191a.png">[1]</a>. The vast majority of black inventors are mischlinges of white ancestry. It's the sad truth we all must accept, african-americans owe their intelligence to being a crossbreed with Europeans.</p>

<h1>Alfred Sharpton</h1>
<p>Alfred Sharpton lived with his single mother in a ghetto neighborhood <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAzoxvJCEKE">[1]</a>, meanwhile, Alfred Sharpton's father lived in a wealthy neighborhood. Alfred Sharpton's father was a slumlord who took advantange of poor black people <a href="https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/politics/national/2004race/5570/">[2]</a>. Alfred Sharpton's father created a Woody Allen situation by marrying Alfred Sharpton's step sister <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edVSQkAN_hw">[3]</a>. Alfred Sharpton spent his entire life searching for a father figure, he thought he found one in James Brown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAzoxvJCEKE">[4]</a>. Don't you think that's sad? The only father figure he had turned out to be a literal psychopath who abuses women. James Brown was arrested for assaulting his wife with a lead pipe, and firing a gun at a car that she was in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQmqcaS5LIM">[5]</a>.</p>



<h1>Value of Money</h1>
<p>A long time ago, a man learned that money and power attracts women; directly or indirectly. Ever since then, men have been obsessed with money and material objects. Without money, men feel hideous and ugly. When a man believes he is ugly, it makes his penis limp. When a man has verified symbols on social media, it allows him to message any woman he wants. Men don't want average women. Men want beautiful instagram models.</p> 

<p>El Chapo Guzman utilized all his wealth and power to invite his celebrity crush Kate Del Castillo into his home, and it actually worked <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/el-chapo-speaks-40784/">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>In our society, there are two types of masculinity. The first is when a man is a self made billionaire able to support his wife, children, lamborghini, gucci clothing, and beautiful mansion estate. This is the goal every man dreams. When a man 

he mostly likely will never accomplish this dream, he resorts to this second type of masculinity. The second masculinity is when a man starts to hate rich people, he blames rich people for everything.</p>

<p>Scientists said violence occurs whenever low income men feel sexually insecure about their small bank account, so low income men overcompensate through acting extra tough and masculine <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0305-750X(00)00122-4">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>Mohammed Bello's wealth allowed him to house and feed each of his 86 wives and 150 offsprings <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwM1ncuYAAg">[1]</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVhJFM1bsJ0">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>White men and Black men are fighting to control the world's money. If you control the money, you control women and sex. I know this sound crazy, but just look at the evidence. In 319 years, Humans went from a population of 600 million to 7.7 billion <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/11/Annual-World-Population-since-10-thousand-BCE-for-OWID.png">[3]</a>. Before that it took 11,700 years to reach 600 million. And before that it took 287,982 years to reach 4 million. Sex is a major influence of how our society is structured today. Sex is so important, in fact, since you are reading this, there is a very high chance you are alive because of sex. Sex that your parents had.</p>

<p>Of course, not all men are like this. However, it only takes one crazy person to wreak havoc on Earth. The September 11 attacks, it only took 5 people to murder 2,977 innocent civilians. The 2017 Las Vegas Shooting, it only took one person to injure 411 innocent civilians and murder 60 innocent civilians. The richest 1% own 44% of the world's wealth <a href="https://inequality.org/facts/global-inequality/">[1]</a>. And who are the 1% percent? Men. In the Unites States, the richest 1% is almost entirely composed of men. Specifically, 95.5% of the richest 1% are men <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1536504220902196">[2]</a>. And examining Forbes' list of the richest women in the world <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinstoller/2020/04/07/the-top-10-richest-women-in-the-world-2020/">[3]</a>., you will notice 100% of the top 10 richest women in the world are not self made billionaires. The vast majority of the time when a woman is a billionaire it's because that woman inherited a wealth or business from a husband or a father.</p>

<h1>Greed of Slavery</h1>
<p>The truth of why White men purchased slaves, and why Black men sold slaves. Because every man has a sexual fantasy in their mind. This sexual fantasy involves purchasing a big house with luxuries because it attracts pornstars to have sex with. White men and Black men will do anything to accomplish this sexual fantasy, including purchasing and selling slaves.</p>

<p>A journalist named Michael Scott Moore was kidnapped by Somali pirates, he was captive as ransom for 2 years. While the average Somali citizen earned less than one dollar per day, Michael Moore observed Somali gangmembers owned fancy cars and mansions. One Somali gangmember bragged how every bullet on their belt cost one dollar each. Some joined gangs to avoid poverty, but Michael Moore observed the vast majority joined gangs because of greed.

<h1>African Men Sold Their Own</h1>
<p>"The historians John Thornton and Linda Heywood of Boston University estimate that 90 percent of those shipped to the New World were enslaved by Africans and then sold to European traders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html">[3]</a>."</p>

<p>Nat Amarteifio says "The Europeans weren’t going out and capturing Africans. They couldn’t — they got sick and died from illnesses like malaria <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-08-20/willful-amnesia-how-africans-forgot-and-remembered-their-role-slave-trade">[2]</a>."</p> 

<p>24% of Nigerians possess the Sickle Cell trait <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/20890">[1]</a>. Sickle Cell trait provides 60% immunity against malaria <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/biology/index.html#tabs-1-4">[2]</a>. Millions of Africans possess 100% immunity against malaria, from being repeatedly exposed to it <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1128%2FCMR.00025-08">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>Africans sold slaves and killed elephants. According to Smithsonian, Africans have killed elephants since atleast 1400CE <a href="https://africa.si.edu/collection/conservation/protect-ivory/">[1]</a>. In 1800CE there were 26 million elephants in Africa <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/media/history-ivory-trade/">[2]</a>. In 1979CE there were only 600,000 elephants. The purpose of killing elephants was to collect ivory tusk. Adam Ruins Everything is one of the most progressive liberal television shows on the internet. Adam Ruins Everything criticises police brutality, and the Amerian prison system. However, even Adam Ruins Everything says that white people killing animals for trophy hunting is a minor issue compared to the systemic killings Africans do to collect ivory tusk <a href=" https://youtu.be/YUA8i5S0YMU?t=65">[3]</a>. Africans sell ivory tusk to whites and chinese people, because some believe ivory tusk cures erectile dysfuntion. That is why in America you find these erectile dysfuntion pills everywhere called Rhino <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/108844/download">[4]</a>. So white men purchase ivory to cure erectile dysfunction, and African men sell ivory for the purpose of earning money to purchase a big house with luxuries because it attracts pornstars to have sex with.</p>

<h1>Black Women</h1>
<p>You are a Black woman. You suffered worse than any man in history. You worked in cotton fields while pregnant. White men dug holes the size of your pregnant stomach to fit in the ground as they flogged you. You deserve a movement of your own. #BlackLivesMatter is not doing enough to represent Black women.</p>

<p>"United States Sentencing Commission," says black women receive 29.7% SHORTER prison sentences than white men <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/demographic-differences-sentencing">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>"Mapping Police Violence," says 96.2% of african-americans killed by police are male victims <a href="../mappingpoliceviolence.html">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>32.2% of black men, 5.9% of white men, 5.6% of black women, and 0.9% of white women will be imprisoned <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lifetime-likelihood-by-race.png">[5]</a> <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=836">[6]</a>. Black women were slaves too, and yet Black women perpetrate fewer crime than Black men and White men. The crime statistics suggests every man on Earth is a potential threat <a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*tF8MqygzkichswdWkK8nSA.png">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>Oluwatoyin Salau was an ardent supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5UsGk0GDRs">[1]</a>. In the end, Oluwatoyin Salau was raped and murdered by a black man named Aaron Glee Jr. Oluwatoyin Salau was murdered by the same black men whom she was trying to help.</p> 

<h1>White Women</h1>
<p>White men invented slavery and then forced White women to accept it. Until 1920, White women were forbidden from politics. This viral video shows a white woman doing a false police report against a black man. We called this White woman a murderer. But how are white women murderers, when it is always a white man pulling the trigger? 87.2% of police officers are male <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/tables/table-74">[4]</a>. What is White Privilege worth for women when all women afraid of being killed and raped. Women are not allowed to leave their homes.</p>

<p>White women owned slaves, but her slaves were often gifts that white men offered <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/10/25/white-women-slaveholders-q-a/">[3]</a>.</p>

<h1>Afrocentrism</h1>
<p>A common afrocentric argument of how Europe ostensibly destroyed Africa. "Africa's primitive state gave Europeans the economic advantage. European merchants offered cheaper prices than African merchants, so African businesses failed. This put Africa in debt, and the only option Africa had to pay their debt was selling slaves. Africa would be advanced if Europe had left Africa alone."

<p>John Thornton debunked the aforementioned theory <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL454363W/Africa_and_Africans_in_the_making_of_the_Atlantic_world_1400-1680?edition=isbn_9780521398640">[4]</a>. Africans rarely purchased essential items from the Europeans, instead the Africans purchased nonessential "novelty items" such as metal knives, beads, mirrors, rum, and guns. In other words, African men sold slaves because of greed. According to John Thornton [page 52], the historian Ray A. Kea compiled a list of the top 150 popular items in the Gold Coast that Africans purchased from Europeans, 47 out of 150 were items of clothing. Africans produced their own luxury clothing, and clothing was so afforable that even peasants owned clothes, but nobody wanted to dress like a peasant. According to John Thornton [page 51], a contemporay European during 1673 described Africans as "The Akans are so vain about what they wear ... and whatever appeals to them at a particular time they must have, even if they have to pay twice as much for it," and "at one moment they like this new fashion, at another moment that; and whatever appeals to them at a particular time they must have ... This is why so many goods remain unsold and are sent back to Europe at great loss." Perhaps one reason why Africans spent so much money on clothes, John Thornton noted, is because Africans did not pay rent. African cultures simply did not have any concept of buying and selling territories.</p> 

<p>Great Britain imported 3,259,440 african slaves. The USA imported 305,326 african slaves. It's safe to say, Africans purchased clothes that were manufactured by slaves.</p>

<p>Nike products are manufactured by sweatshops workers who were paid 15 cents per hour during 1997, and 89 cents per hour during 2003 <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nike-workers-pay-kaepernick/">[1]</a>. Adidas products are also manufactured in sweatshops.</p>

<p>In 2020, some Indians boycotted Jeff Bezos, because Amazon.com's cheap prices allegedly caused Indian businesses to fail <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51117315">[4]</a>.</p> 

<p>Another common afrocentric argument is "Africans were unaware of slavery abuses in the New World. Africans owned slaves, but loved their slaves like a family. Meanwhile, Europeans tortured their slaves."</p>

<h1>Invention of Slavery</h1>
<p>The idea of slavery started when humans were hunting and gathering. It started with an inspiration like "What if I could hit someone on their head, and force them to bring me food?" During hunter gatherer times, real slavery did not exist, because your slaves easily escaped.</p>
<p>Real slavery started around 10,000BCE during the agricultural revolution. During agriculture times, your slaves did not easily escape, because the only alternative of being a slave was being a hunter gatherer. Ancient people on different continents independently discovered and practiced slavery. "Code of Hammurabi" details slavery in ancient Mesopotamia from 1,754BCE <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/slavery-sociology/The-law-of-slavery">[3]</a>. "Laws of Manu" details slavery in ancient India from 100BCE. "Tang Code" details slavery in ancient China from 624CE. "Quran" details slavery in ancient Middle East from 632CE.</p>

<h1>Education</h1>
<p>Stop saying that poverty causes crime. To say that poverty causes crime is like saying absence of sex causes rape. Seriously? How many years of college education does it cost to learn that killing and raping is wrong?</p>

<p>During 2019, 110,812 female college students participated in this survey <a href="https://www.aau.edu/key-issues/campus-climate-and-safety/aau-campus-climate-survey-2019">[1]</a>. 24% of verbal sexual harassment against female graduate students was perpetrated by college employees; such as a teacher, advisor, faculty, coach, trainer, etc. Depending on how rape is defined, 10.9% to 16.2% of female college students experienced a completed or an attempted rape. 73.3% of female college students said their rapist was a fellow college student.</p>

<p>How is college supposed to fix society, when the college employees themselves are the ones perpetrating sexual harassment? According to Global Study on Homicide, 34% of murdered women were murdered by their intimate partner, and "Men who kill their intimate partners have a markedly different profile to men who kill outside relationships, according to studies from several European countries. They tend to have better jobs and enjoy a higher standard of living than other perpetrators, and often have no criminal background. One study found that men who killed their partners were better educated than other homicide perpetrators and had fewer gaps in their employment history <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/global-study-on-homicide.html">[1]</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1077801204265015">[2]</a>."</p>

<h1>Domestic Violence</h1>
<p>During 1995 to 1996, 8,000 women participated in a telephone survey <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/app/publications/abstract.aspx?id=172837">[5]</a>. It observed that 14.8% of women were victims of a completed rape, 2.8% of women were victims of an attempted rape. 22.1% of women were victims of a physical assault from an intimate partner. 8% of women had felt terrorized by a stalker. </p>

<p>During 2015, 5,758 women participated in a telephone survey <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nisvs/summaryreports.html">[6]</a>. It was learned that 21.3% of women were victims of either a completed or an attempted rape. 16% of women had felt terrorized by stalkers. 37% of women were victims of an unwanted sexual contact.</p> 

<p>Rodney King had children with 3 different women. All of Rodney King's marriages ended in divorce. During 1999, Rodney King was arrested for doing domestic violence <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-nov-30-me-king30-story.html">[9]</a>. On October 2003, Rodney King was arrested because he punched some woman. During 2005, Rodney King was arrested for threatening to kill his wife, and threatening to kill one of his daughters.</p>

<p>Alton sterling was arrested for domestic violence, and was a registered sex offender <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/alton-sterling-arrest-record/">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>George Floyd was arrested for aggravated robbery, he pressed a pistol onto a woman's abdomen <a href="../georgefloyd.html">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>. James Brown was Al Sharpton's "father figure <a href="https://youtu.be/aq5DheldSqc">[2]</a>." Al Sharpton is a famous #BlackLivesMatter activist.</p>

<p>Catherine Robinson's marriage with Noah Robinson disintegrated, because Noah Robinson was 33 years old when he committed adultery by impregnating a 16 year old girl named Helen Burns <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/31/us/noah-l-robinson-88-father-of-jesse-jackson.html">[1]</a>. On October 8, 1941, Helen Burns gave birth to Noah Robinson's son, the son was named Jesse Jackson because Helen Burns went on to marry Charles Jackson. When Jesse Jackson was 7 years old, he realized Charles Jackson was not his real father. Jesse Jackson went on to become a famous #BlackLivesMatter civil right's activist. In 1962, Jesse Jackson married Jacqueline Brown, they produced 5 offsprings together. Jesse Jackson and Jacqueline Brown were married for 38 years, then in 2001 it was publicly revealed that Jesse Jackson had committed adultery because he impregnated his subordinate co-worker Karin Stanford. Karin Stanford was in love with Jesse Jackson, during 1997 she published an entire book about him <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Boundaries-Reverend-International-American/dp/0791434451/">[2]</a>. In fact the only reason they met is Karin Stanford interviewed him as research for that book. Karin Stanford wrote an essay that provided insight of the affair from her own perspective <a href="https://cnsnews.com/news/article/jesse-jacksons-mistress-claims-blacks-scapegoated-her">[1]</a> <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Because_I_Said_So.html?id=G7X-ONRUeCoC">[2]</a>. When Karin Stanford was a kid, she lived in her mind's fairy tale, but was disillusioned by the harsh facts of life. This explains why Karin Stanford fell for Jesse Jackson. Karin Stanford desired a man who can protect her from the "wolves at the door," was her metaphor. Jesse Jackson was a man who understood the world's issues and tried to correct them. Karin Stanford naively believed the lies Jesse Jackson told, that he does not love his wife Jacqueline Brown, he only married Jacqueline Brown for political purposes. When Karin Stanford learned she was pregnant with Jesse Jackson's child, Jesse Jackson promised to pay for their child to have life insurance and college education <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0108/17/tl.00.html">[4]</a>. So that was how his affair was exposed, when Jesse Jackson's employees accused him of misusing public funds to pay Karin Stanford $76,000 <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/02/01/jackson.money/index.html">[4]</a> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-jan-19-mn-14325-story.html">[5]</a>. Although, in reality Karin Stanford only received $36,000 because the payments ceased abruptly when the scandal started. Jesse Jackson's publicist insisted the $76,000 was owed to Karin Stanford due to her employment. That was how Jesse Jackson was acquitted of fraud. The moral of the story is when you donate to a charity, you never know if that money is benefiting poor communities, or is helping a horny man pay his sugar mamma.</p>

<p>Karin Stanford who is herself an African-American woman and breast cancer survivor, she criticised blacks who supported Clarence Thomas, Mike Tyson, OJ Simpson, and R Kelly. Karin Stanford spent her whole life defending minorites, but was outcasted by those same minorities simply because she had sex with a man. Karin Stanford became unemployed. She was revoked by the Democratic National Committee. She said the "black establishment" had labeled her a gold digger. Karin Stanford who earned herself a doctoral  because of ethics and principles she never accepted money from tabloids, that all she wanted was for Jesse Jackson to pay child support. In 2012, Jesse Jackson owed $11,694.50 in child support <a href="https://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/jesse-jackson-deadbeat-dad/">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>In 1984 <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=124046">[3]</a> and 1996 <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=8qw0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT92">[4]</a>, Jacqueline Brown said quotes that suggests Jesse Jackson perpetrated decades of extra marital affairs, and Jacqueline Brown was fully aware of it, Jacqueline Brown simply preferred living in denial or complicity. In 2020, Jacqueline Brown is still married to Jesse Jackson.</p>

<p>Jesse Jackson's eldest son named Jesse Jackson Jr. went on to be a successful democratic politician. In 2013, Jesse Jackson Jr. was sentenced to prison, because Jesse Jackson Jr. committed fraud by spending $750,000 of his campaign funds on luxury clothing for himself to wear <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/chi-jesse-jackson-jr-sandi-jackson-plea-hearings-wednesday-20130219-story.html">[1]</a>. For example, Jesse Jackson Jr. spent $43,350 on one Rolex wrist watch. Jesse Jackson's other son named Jonathan Jackson defended Jesse Jackson Jr.. Jonathan Jackson basically said that what Jesse Jackson Jr. did is not the worst thing in the world, because Jesse Jackson Jr. was only stealing money from rich wealthy elites, it's not like he was stealing from the poor, and stealing $750,000 is nothing compared to the trillions white people steal everday from all of us average Americans, and Jesse Jackson Jr. only got caught because of his skin color, white people do fraud all the time but they don't get caught because they have white privilege <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/archive/9308647/">[2]</a>. While Jesse Jackson Jr. is still in prison, Jesse Jackson Jr. is receiving annually approx $38,400 from the government, and approx $100,000 from worker's compensation, because Jesse Jackson Jr. had conveniently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder immediately around the time when the allegations against him started <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-jesse-jackson-junior-federal-benefits-met-20170222-story.html">[3]</a>. 

<p>Chuck Berry was arrested for punching some woman's face <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chuck-berry-farewell-to-the-father-of-rock-118589/">[12]</a>. Chuck Berry installed hidden cameras in the women's restroom of a restaurant that he owned. There was a video of Chuck Berry urinating on a woman, and the same woman defecating on Chuck Berry's face <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=akzvdiyCQ1EC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q&f=false">[13]</a>. Chuck Berry allegedly had sex with a 14 year old runaway prostitute named Janice Escalanti.</p>

<p>The Cuban-American Ray Diaz was raised in foster care <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSPjf3jqO_Y">[1]</a>. Ray Diaz appeared on the Hulu series "East Los High," and he appeared on Jake Paul's vlogs. In 2019, Ray Diaz was arrested for sexual assault <a href="https://twitter.com/LAPDHQ/status/1149895928242819072">[2]</a>. Ray Diaz's alleged victims are <a href="https://www.instagram.com/landihicks/">Landi Hicks</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/angelicasalek/">Angelica Salek</a>. Below are audio recordings of Ray Diaz verbally tormenting his victims, some includes audio of Ray Diaz slapping women. The audio was from this youtube playlist <a href="raydiaz.html">[3]</a>. The audio is disturbing, you probably should not listen to the audio if you have PTSD or Vicarious Traumatization. To be honest, I don't know if Ray Diaz was ever found guilty.
