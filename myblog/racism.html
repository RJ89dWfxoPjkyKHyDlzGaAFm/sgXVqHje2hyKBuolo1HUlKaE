<p>Racism does not exist. Here's why.</p>

<p>"United States Sentencing Commission," it says Black females receive 29.7% SHORTER prison sentences than white males <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/demographic-differences-sentencing">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>"Mapping Police Violence," it says 96.2% of african-americans killed by police are male victims.</p>

<p>It is clear that mostly black men are being killed by cops. This means that cops are not racist, they are sexist. Black females receive shorter prison sentences than white males. In our justice system, this means black females have more privilege than white males.</p>

<p>This is my message to all black women. I hope you realize somehow that you are absolutely being brainwashed by the Black Lives Matter Movement. You are being taught to hate white people. It is proven that white females are the most statistically docile people on Earth <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lifetime-likelihood-by-race.png">[2]</a>. And yet the BLM teaches black women how to bully white women called "Karens."</p>

<p>The most famous Karen, a white woman who made a false police report on an innocent black man <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFjxye6T4fk">[3]</a>.</p> I understand this false police report could have resulted in the execution of this innocent black man. However, we must remember that the Karen herself does not physically pull the trigger. It is almost always a white MAN who kills the innocent black person. 87.2% of police officers are male <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/tables/table-74">[4]</a>. And we have already mentioned that worldwide 94% of convicted killers are male. The evidence is clear. White women are rarely killers.</p>

<p>The Black Lives Matter Movement is a lie. White women are not your enemies. White women are the victims too.</p>

<p>During 1995 to 1996, 8,000 women participated in a national random digit telephone survey <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/app/publications/abstract.aspx?id=172837">[5]</a>. It was learned that 14.8% of women were victims of a completed rape, 2.8% of women were victims of an attempted rape. 51.9% of women were victims of a physical assault such as slapped, hit, pushed, grabbed, shoved, etc. 22.1% of women were victims of a physical assault from an intimate partner. 8% of women were victims of stalkers. </p>

<p>During 2015, 5,758 women participated in a national random digit telephone survey <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nisvs/summaryreports.html">[6]</a>. It was learned that 21.3% of women were victims of either a completed or an attempted rape. 37% of women were victims of an unwanted sexual contact such as kissed, fondled, groped, grabbed, etc. 16% of women were victims of stalkers which made them feel very fearful, or believed that she or someone close to them would be harmed or killed.</p> 

<p>I interviewed men who have said "Women enjoy being abused and degraded. That's why the best selling women's book is Fifty Shades of Gray."</p>

<p>I interviewed men who have said "There are approximately 400,000 homicides per year. Even if men did all of it... That is still nothing compared to the atrocities that women do. For example, women induce 41.6 million abortions per year <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61575-X">[6]</a>. Abortion is murder."</p>

<p>I interviewed men who have said "Women lie, cheat, and make false police reports. You can never trust rape statistics. The other day I touched a woman's shoulder. I bet she told everyone it was sexual abuse."</p>

<p>With the story of Lorena Bobbit, let's examine why women do crimes. Lorena Bobbit is a latina woman, who suffered years of psychological trauma, physical assault, and rape from the perpetrator named John Bobbit. One evening, John Bobbit arrived home, consumed alcohol, raped Lorena Bobbit, and then John Bobbit fell asleep. Then, with a kitchen knife Lorena Bobbit literally severed John Bobbit's penis. John Bobbit didn't feel it because he was unconscious from alcohol intoxication. Lorena Bobbit reported the incident to the police. John Bobbit was taken to a hospital where a doctor surgically reattached the penis together, and the penis healed and returned to functioning normally. When the police interrogated Lorena Bobbit, she replied "He always have orgasm [sic], and he doesn't wait for me ever to have orgasm. He's selfish." In court, this quote was shown as evidence that the sex was consentual. So John Bobbit was acquitted. Less than a year later in 1994, John Bobbit physically assaulted a woman named Kristina Elliott; and so John Bobbit was in jail for 15 days. When John Bobbit was released from 15 days in jail, he became a successful porn star due to his unique "frankenpenis." In 1999, John Bobbit was on probation for theft. Finally, John Bobbit went to prison because he broke his probation by physically assaulting Joanna Ferrell.</p>

<p>In 2019, a judge asked a female rape victim if she had closed her legs <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-stirs-uproar-alleged-rape-victim-closed-legs/story?id=62185027">[7]</a>. During 2016, a video was published with a quote by Donald Trump "Grab 'em by the pussy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYqKx1GuZGg">[8]</a>." </p>

<p>Rodney King had children with 3 different women. All of Rodney King's marriages ended in divorce. During 1999, Rodney King was arrested for doing domestic violence <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-nov-30-me-king30-story.html">[9]</a>. On October 2003, Rodney King was arrested because he punched some woman in the stomach. During 2005, Rodney King was arrested for threatening to kill his wife, and threatening to kill one of his daughters.</p>

<p>Alton sterling had been arrested for domestic violence and he was a registered sex offender <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/alton-sterling-arrest-record/">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>George Floyd had been arrested for a robbery, in which George Floyd had pressed a pistol onto a woman's abdomen <a href="../georgefloyd.html">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>James Brown had been arrested for domestic violence, in which James Brown fired a gun at his wife, and assaulted her with a lead pipe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQmqcaS5LIM">[12]</a>.</p>

<p>Chuck Berry had been arrested for physical assault, in which Chuck Berry punched a woman's face <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chuck-berry-farewell-to-the-father-of-rock-118589/">[12]</a>. Chuck Berry owned a restaurant, in which Chuck Berry installed hidden cameras in the women's restroom. An investigation discovered a video of Chuck Berry having consentual sex with a woman, in which Chuck Berry urinated on the woman, and then the woman defecated on Chuck Berry's face <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=akzvdiyCQ1EC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q&f=false">[13]</a>. Chuck Berry allegedly had sex with a 14 year old runaway prostitute named Janice Escalanti. Chuck Berry's lyrics of "My Ding A Ling" is about masturbation. Chuck Berry's lyrics of "Sweet Little Sixteen" is about the age of consent. However, Chuck Berry claimed he was somehow a victim of a racist conspiracy.</p>

<p>The Story of Ray Diaz. Ray Diaz was internet famous due to his appearance on Jake Paul's Youtube channel. Ray Diaz was involved in a drama for being 32 years old and commenting "Dream Girl," "Stunning," and "Hair on Fleek" to the instagram of a famous 16 year old named Loren Gray <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ccbEhZYTc">[14]</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5y5pEnZp14">[15]</a>. Ray Diaz defended himself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpTsHXbnmaQ">[16]</a>. Ray Diaz claimed that he was randomly messaging famous people on instagram, just trying to make new friends, so that he could inadvertently further his own career. Ray Diaz apologized, insisted he was unaware of Loren Gray's age. One month later, Ray Diaz was arrested for doing domestic violence on Landi Hicks. Landi Hicks told her story <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hukkp9NOTw">[17]</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, Ray Diaz and Landi Hicks were strangers walking on the same sidewalk at Hollywood Boulevard, California. Ray Diaz asked "You're so pretty, may I please have your instagram?" At first, Landi Hicks said "No. I have a boyfriend." Landi Hicks departured into a restaurant. When Landi Hicks exited the restaurant, Ray Diaz was there outside again, Ray Diaz had waited thoughtfully for Landi Hicks. Landi Hicks considered it a romantic gesture and she finally told Ray Diaz her instagram username. This was how Ray Diaz and Landi Hicks slowly became boyfriend and girlfriend together.</p>

<p>In the beginning, their relationship was perfect. Unexpectedly, Landi Hicks suffered an injury which made it impossible for her to continue being in dance school. Ray Diaz offered to financially support Landi Hicks, so that Landi Hicks would not return to her parents who lived in Florida, United States. Landi Hicks accepted Ray Diaz's offer. And that was how Landi Hicks and Ray Diaz started living together. After one month of living in Ray Diaz's apartment, Landi Hicks wanted to return to her parent's home. Ray Diaz expressed his own worry, that he could not be in a long distance relationship with Landi Hicks, that he could not fathom the pain if Landi Hicks cheated in Florida. Ray Diaz told Landi Hicks that if she returned to Florida, then that means they are broken up. That was how Landi Hicks was convinced on staying with Ray Diaz on the following months.</p>

<p>The domestic violence began 3 or 4 months in the relationship. Landi Hicks secretly recorded audio of an incident when Ray Diaz was abusive. The audio <a href="https://youtu.be/6hukkp9NOTw?t=422">[18]</a> is Ray Diaz yelling "I don't give a f**k how many people you tell that I called you a b***h and spit on you. [...] You ungrateful b***h trying to sneak behind my f***ing back." Ray Diaz often went out with his friends, but when Landi Hicks attempted the same, Ray Diaz reprimanded her. Landi Hicks was essentially a prisoner. One incident Landi Hicks attempted to leave Ray Diaz's apartment, so Ray Diaz choked Landi Hicks. Another incident Ray Diaz grabbed, pushed, and slammed Landi Hicks, as Landi Hicks attempted to call the police, Ray Diaz desparately faked a demonic possesion that prevented Landi Hicks from leaving the apartment. Two days later, Landi Hicks successfully reported Ray Diaz to the police. The police commanded Landi Hicks to never return to Ray Diaz's apartment, since her life was threatened. Landi Hicks abandoned her macbook and clothes in California, as she hastily returned to Florida, and the police arrested Ray Diaz. 

<p>Two weeks later, Landi Hick was living with her parents in Florida. There Landi Hicks received a text message that her macbook was shipped by mail to a dance studio which Landi Hick's mother owned. Landi Hicks thought it was possible that the police had shipped her macbook to her. When Landi Hicks appeared at her mother's dance studio, Landi Hicks did not find her macbook, instead Landi Hicks was ambushed by Ray Diaz and two of Ray Diaz's relatives. Ray Diaz begged Landi Hicks to please come back. Landi Hicks drove away, but was followed home by Ray Diaz's two relatives.</p>


<p>Some of Ray Diaz's other victims shared audio recordings <a href="https://youtu.be/AqxmWw-yrFo?t=107">[19]</a>. One audio is Ray Diaz arguing and slapping a woman, and the woman cries. The other audio is Ray Diaz arguing like an utter maniac. Suddenly, Ray Diaz's exgirlfriend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/angelicasalek/?hl=en">Angelica Salek</a> disappeared, went missing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT8CYEEpUFQ">[20]</a>. Because Angelica Salek posted an audio of Ray Diaz verbally tormenting Angelica Salek, Ray Diaz was accused of kidnapping Angelica Salek. Ray Diaz responded with a video proclaiming his innocence. The police searched Ray Diaz's home but could not find Angelica Salek in his apartment. Suddenly, Angelica Salek posted a video explaining that she ran away because of family issues unrelated to Ray Diaz. Angelica Salek insisted the audio which her mother posted was taken out of context, that the audio was simply Ray Diaz practicing voice acting because Ray Diaz wanted to pursue some acting career. Angelica Salek mentioned that she accidentally left her phone at her parents home, which was how her mom discovered that audio. Since Angelica Salek did not have her phone, Angelica Salek was temporarily locked out of instagram, so it seemed like she was missing, when she was unable to post her whereabouts on instagram.</p>

<p>Several days later, Angelica Salek made a new confession <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufYkpHgQdM4">[21]</a>. Angelica Salek confessed that she was being coerced by Ray Diaz, that the audio recordings were not voice acting. The voice acting was a lie that Ray Diaz invented. Also, Ray Diaz coached Angelica's previous video, and when the police arrived, Ray Diaz evaded the police by cutting a hole underneath his box mattress and commanding Angelica Salek to go in the mattress box. Angelica Salek shared additional audio of Ray Diaz. Angelica Salek spoke with others of Ray Diaz's victims, and Angelica Salek realized Ray Diaz was quite methodical with how he abused women. Angelica Salek theorized that Ray Diaz even wrote scripts because his victim's stories were so similar. And that's the end of Ray Diaz's story. Ray Diaz is still out here in the free world living his best life. Ray Diaz never went to prison. Ray Diaz even convinced the judge that he was the one being abused, and the judge granted Ray Diaz a restraining order against Landi Hicks.</p>
