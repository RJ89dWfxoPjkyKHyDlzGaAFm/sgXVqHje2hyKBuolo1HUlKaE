<p>Here I want to convince you that the Black Lives Matter movement is a toxic black men's rights movement. Its ultimate purpose is to overthrow the white patriarchy and replace it with a black partriarchy.</p>  

<p>"United States Sentencing Commission," says black women receive 29.7% SHORTER prison sentences than white men <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/demographic-differences-sentencing">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>"Mapping Police Violence," says 96.2% of african-americans killed by police are male victims <a href="../mappingpoliceviolence.html">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Nat Amarteifio says "The Europeans weren’t going out and capturing Africans. They couldn’t — they got sick and died from illnesses like malaria <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-08-20/willful-amnesia-how-africans-forgot-and-remembered-their-role-slave-trade">[2]</a>.</p>." 

<p>"The historians John Thornton and Linda Heywood of Boston University estimate that 90 percent of those shipped to the New World were enslaved by Africans and then sold to European traders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html">[3]</a>."</p>

<p>110,812 female college students participated in a survey during 2019 <a href="https://www.aau.edu/key-issues/campus-climate-and-safety/aau-campus-climate-survey-2019">[1]</a>. 24% of verbal sexual harassment against female graduate students was perpetrated by a college employee; such as a teacher, advisor, faculty, coach, trainer, etc. Depending on how rape is defined, 10.9% to 16.2% of female college students experienced a completed or attempted rape. 73.3% of female college students said their rapist was a fellow college student.</p>

<p>Politicians are glorifying college education. How is college supposed to fix society, when the college employees themselves are the ones pepetrating rape culture? How is employment supposed to fix society, when there is workplace sexual harassment? According to a Global Study on Homicide, "Men who kill their intimate partners have a markedly different profile to men who kill outside relationships, according to studies from several European countries. They tend to have better jobs and enjoy a higher standard of living than other perpetrators, and often have no criminal background. One study found that men who killed their partners were better educated than other homicide perpetrators and had fewer gaps
in their employment history."</p>

<p>In other words, the Black Lives Matter Movement is not going to stop the violence against black women.</p>

<p>Here is a video of black men bullying a white woman dubbed as "Karen." Karen hit her head so many times that her head started bleeding <a href="https://twitter.com/sreed101/status/1278572389144637440">[4]</a>. One black man laughed at her, he said "Stupid ass!" Meanwhile a woman in the background said "I want to go check on her."</p>

<p>Here is a video of a black man bullying a white woman dubbed as "Karen." Karen called him the N word. So the black man stalked, followed her home, and doxxed her <a href="https://twitter.com/wypipo_h8/status/1275228765941977089">[3]</a>. Apparently, it is racist to suggest this white woman could have a mental disorder. Just look at her, the poor woman on her knees. I think she is mad at the world since society tells her she is too ugly, so she settled for a man that beats her up everyday. Just a theory. And no I am not racist. I am sexist.</p> 

<p>32.2% of black men and 5.6% of black women will be imprisoned <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lifetime-likelihood-by-race.png">[5]</a> <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=836">[6]</a>. Black Women were slaves too, and yet Black Women perpetrate fewer crime than White Men. 5.9% of white men and 0.9% of white women will be imprisoned. Call me a racist or whatever, but I have seen the crime statistics. And the crime statistics tells me that I should lock my door everytime I see a white man or black man. The crime statistics tells me that every man on Earth is a potential threat <a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*tF8MqygzkichswdWkK8nSA.png

<p>Karens are not criminals. Karens are victims.</p>

<p>During 1995 to 1996, 8,000 women participated in a telephone survey <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/app/publications/abstract.aspx?id=172837">[5]</a>. It observed that 14.8% of women were victims of a completed rape, 2.8% of women were victims of an attempted rape. 22.1% of women were victims of a physical assault from an intimate partner. 8% of women had felt terrorized by a stalker. </p>

<p>During 2015, 5,758 women participated in a national random digit telephone survey <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nisvs/summaryreports.html">[6]</a>. It was learned that 21.3% of women were victims of either a completed or an attempted rape. 16% of women had felt terrorized by stalkers. 37% of women were victims of an unwanted sexual contact.</p> 

<p>On this paragpraph I will explain a common Black Lives Matter Movement rhetoric of how Europe ruined Africa. Many years ago, Africa was a primitive civilization, meanwhile Europe was an already established civilization. This gave Europeans an economic advantage in Africa. Europeans merchants offered cheaper prices so much that it destroyed Africa's economy. Africans could not afford to purchase from African merchants as it was cheaper to buy from Europeans. This put Africa in debt and the only option Africa had to pay their debt was by selling slaves. Africa would be advanced if Europe left Africa alone. John Thornton disputed this theory. Historical evidence proved Africa rarely purchased essential resources from Europeans, instead Africans often purchased "novelty items" such as metal knives, beads, mirrors, rum, and guns. Now I am remembering when I was in High School, I sat next to a group of latinos, one of them said "I saved all my money for the upcoming Nike Air Jordans. I'm not going to have food for a whole week. It's gonna be worth it for the new shoes."</p>

<p>In other words, the transatlantic slave trade was invented by greedy black men and greedy white men. White women did own slaves, but the slaves were often gifts that a white man gave them, or the white women inherited the slaves through marriage <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/10/25/white-women-slaveholders-q-a/">[3]</a>. White women are racist simply because white men taught them how to be racist.</p>

<p>In 2020, some Indians boycotted Jeff Bezos, since Amazon.com has cheaper prices so much that it supposedly is damaged India's economy <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51117315">[4]</a>.</p> 


<p>Rodney King had children with 3 different women. All of Rodney King's marriages ended in divorce. During 1999, Rodney King was arrested for doing domestic violence <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-nov-30-me-king30-story.html">[9]</a>. On October 2003, Rodney King was arrested because he punched some woman. During 2005, Rodney King was arrested for threatening to kill his wife, and threatening to kill one of his daughters.</p>

<p>Alton sterling was arrested for domestic violence, and was a registered sex offender <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/alton-sterling-arrest-record/">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>George Floyd was arrested for aggravated robbery, he pressed a pistol onto a woman's abdomen <a href="../georgefloyd.html">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>James Brown was arrested for firing a gun at his wife, and assaulting her with a lead pipe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQmqcaS5LIM">[12]</a>.</p>

<p>Chuck Berry was arrested for punching some woman's face <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chuck-berry-farewell-to-the-father-of-rock-118589/">[12]</a>. Chuck Berry installed hidden cameras in the women's restroom of a restaurant that he owned. There was a video of Chuck Berry urinating on a woman, and the same woman defecating on Chuck Berry's face <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=akzvdiyCQ1EC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q&f=false">[13]</a>. Chuck Berry allegedly had sex with a 14 year old runaway prostitute named Janice Escalanti.</p>

<p>Ray Diaz was internet famous due to his appearances on Jake Paul's vlogs. Ray Diaz was arrested for doing sexual assault and domestic violence. Ray Diaz's known victims are <a href="https://www.instagram.com/landihicks/">Landi Hicks</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/angelicasalek/">Angelica Salek</a>. Below are audio recordings of Ray Diaz verbally tormenting his victims, some includes audio of Ray Diaz slapping women. The audio is disturbing, you should not listen to the audio if you believe you might experience PTSD or Vicarious Traumatization. The audio was from this youtube playlist <a href="raydiaz.html">[14]</a>. To be honest, I don't know if Ray Diaz was ever found guilty. All I know is that if you check Ray Diaz's instagram, he is not in jail or prison, he is plainly out here in the free world living his best life.</p>

<p>On this next section, I want to provide a balanced perspective. I understand that men can be victims of sexual assault and domestic violence too. So I want to discuss the bad things women do.</p>

<p>Brooke Houts was a popular Youtuber who often shared videos of her dog. Brooke Houts portrayed herself as a dog lover. On video Brooke Houts mentioned how punishment is not a good method for training dogs, she says a reward system is a superior method for training dogs. Brooke Houts accidentally uploaded this video file to her Youtube Channel <a href="https://twitter.com/KEEMSTAR/status/1159125336791093249">[18]</a>. It was how Brooke Houts was exposed for doing animal cruelty.</p>


<p>Lorena Bobbit is a latina woman, who suffered years of psychological trauma, physical assault, and rape from the perpetrator named John Bobbit. One evening, John Bobbit arrived home, consumed alcohol, raped Lorena Bobbit, and then John Bobbit fell asleep. With a kitchen knife Lorena Bobbit literally severed John Bobbit's penis. John Bobbit didn't feel it because he was unconscious from alcohol intoxication. Lorena Bobbit reported the incident to the police. John Bobbit was taken to a hospital where a doctor surgically reattached the penis together, and the penis healed and returned to functioning normally. When the police interrogated Lorena Bobbit, she replied "He always have orgasm [sic], and he doesn't wait for me ever to have orgasm. He's selfish." In court, this quote was shown as evidence that the sex was consentual. So John Bobbit was acquitted of rape. In 1994, John Bobbit physically assaulted a woman named Kristina Elliott. In 1999, John Bobbit  physically assaulted a woman named Joanna Ferrell.</p>
