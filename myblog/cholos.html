<p>On this page, I discuss this video <a href="https://www.blogger.com/video.g?token=AD6v5dwxrEPMHJq5cJki8GcZiDNpNivgDJ0YrL39KfBZqHS2TCyu96_pKkyilc1OE1OvVJkQOQJGiYk6V-TvpaE13fMfJmJ1-vwsDd_i2i2XNsvYIDHxEXy-EEAlKDgVc0FNCS8O63sb">[1]</a>.

<p>That video you just saw, depicts a latino teenager, who at the time of that video he was a student in the same High School along with me. I discovered this video when I was young adult browsing Facebook. It was the last video he uploaded on August 21, 2013. He typed the following words along with that video, “Look at this crazy ass bitch u.u , i was on my scooter going home .. c; Like my status if youve seen her around ? lol”. A latina woman who I recognized as being another former student in our High School, she commented “Lmao ! Were You scared or wat cus you kept walking back lol C: Jk XD HAHA”. In total that video has 212 likes, and 45 comments. A different woman who also appears to be a latina, she commented “Sorry but this shit is funnyyy...lmao crazy ass lady”. A latino man commented “shit i need a cart grab that shit lol”.</p>

<p>When I was a High School student, I remember that I saw a group of unsupervised latino children throwing empty soda cans at the same homeless woman from that video.</p> 

<p>When I was a High School student, I encountered a very dark rumor about the same homeless woman from that video. The rumor is allegedly several cholos were yelling at the homeless woman. One cholo exclaimed “Who you talking to huh? Hahaha crazy ass bitch, shut the fuck up, why you talking to yourself, get a fucking job, do something else.” The other cholo exclaimed “You want some money? I'll give you some money, come here suck my dick, and I'll give you this money hahaha.” One cholo replied “I'm the one in need of a job, a blowjob.” The homeless woman yelled back at the cholos. One cholo brandished a firearm, he smacked the firearm onto the homeless woman's face, he said “Shut the fuck up.”</p>
