<h1>Knock at My Door</h1>
<p>One day I was just at home when I heard a mysterious knocking noise at my door. I opened the door, and it was a latina woman, she was my neighbor whom I rarely ever seen, she only spoke spanish, she said "Please, I need your help. Can you tell your aunt to help me? Please, tell her I will be waiting for her outside in front of my house. It's very important. Thank you." I told my aunt. My aunt went to her. And that was how this crazy story unfolded.</p>

<h1>Stockholm Syndrome</h1>
<p>I don't have all the details, because my family keeps secrets from me. However, the reason why I rarely saw this latina woman who was my neighbor, is because she was being abused by her latino husband. She was not allowed to have a job or leave her house. She lived with this man for so many decades, and her husband never purchased menstrual products for her.</p>

<h1>Why Mexico?</h1>
<p>So the woman asked my aunt to research a bus schedule that will take her to Mexico. I don't know if she took a plane or bus, but she is gone now. The reason why that woman left to Mexico. I don't really know. But it has something to do with her 11 year old son. Basically, her 11 year old was bullying kids at his middle school. The school counselors interviewed him, and discovered he was being abused by his mother. The only thing they told me is that ever since he was a baby in the crib, his mother yelled at him "You're ugly. You're worthless. I hate you. Kill yourself." The mother admitted that she was abusing her son like this. She said she was psychologically broken, and that was why she had to leave to Mexico to protect her sons. To be honest, I think she was running away from the police, but I honesty don't know. She has two sons. The 11 year old, and another who was probably like 4 years old at the time. Her two sons still remain here in the United States with that husband man person.</p>

<h1>In the Past</h1>
<p>Before all of this abuse was exposed. Everyone in my family hated that 11 year old kid. Even when he was younger, he was a bully. One time my nephew's brand new toy weapon went missing. My nephew's mother went to that kid, and demanded "Give us back our toy!" The kid said "I don't know where it's at. But I can help you search for it." Then out of nowhere, the kid said "Oh look the toy is over there." My newphew's mother said "I had already checked that place. That kid was hiding the toy and pretended like he found it. That kid is a psychopath." So then my nephew's mother examined that the toy weapon was broken, she said to the kid "Stop destroying our toys! Leave us alone!" The kid replied "I didn't break it. Maybe your son accidentally broke it, but he's lying to you because he doesn't want you to yell at him the way you are yelling at me."</p>

<p>My step-father is a known clinical pathological liar, not the most trustworthy source, but he said "That kid is a psychopath. The other day, some children were playing soccer, the ball landed on our property, I tossed it back to them. The next day, I saw that same ball again, only this time it was flat on that demented kid's lawn. I have a bad feeling about that kid. I think he stabbed a hole in the ball out of jealousy."</p>

<p>One time, I went to my 5 year old nephew and told him "Your mom said you have to go home and eat." Immediately, that kid whispered something in my newphew's ear. I asked my nephew what did that kid tell him, my nephew said "He told me that I shouldn't listen to you. That you are lying and playing a prank on me. That I should stay there and continue playing outside along with him." That kid was trying to get my nephew in trouble.</p>

<p>Everyone around me has commented "That kid is a psychopath," and I just never understood why. I still don't understand why do they think he is a psychopath. It's really messed up, I think everyone is just bullying him, he's just a little kid. I asked my father about it, he said "Everytime I've gone to your house, for years, I observed the only toy that poor kid ever had is that orange toy truck in the dirt. He's had no other toys." I believe this kid feels insecure when other kids have toys, because he's never had toys himself. He breaks their toys because he feels jealous of those who live in non-abusive homes.</p> 



<h1>After the Party</h1>
<p>We had a small family party in our yard. There was music, food, and alcohol. I thought it was a peaceful party. The next day, I found out it was not a peaceful party at all. The day after that party happened, my latina neighbor said "On the day of the party, I couldn't find my cat, I thought she went missing. I saw that kid and his younger brother were playing outside. I asked that kid if he knew where my cat went. That kid pointed me in the right direction. I found my cat. I asked him how did he know where my cat went, and why was my cat trembling, he said he saw his younger brother trying to hug my cat, and the cat ran away. I have a bad feeling about that kid. I think he was trying to harm my cat."</p>

<p>The next thing I learned is, during that same party my uncle was about to be in a fist fight with my one latino neighbor who is the father of that one kid everyone says is a psychopath. I was so annoyed at my uncle. I assumed it was my uncle's fault, because one time my drunk uncle got in a fist fight with my other drunk uncle. My drunk uncle said "You are a son of a b***h!" My other drunk uncle replied "We have the same mother! That means you called your own mother a b***h!" My drunk uncle replied "Don't you dare call my mother a b***h! She gave birth to you!" And they started punching eachother. So then I learned why my uncle was about to fight my latino neighbor. It's because at the party, my latino neighbor was saying disgusting vile things about my uncle's sister who is my mother, he said "I love your sister. I've loved her ever since I moved here. I want to have sex with her. When her husband dies, I will be there to replace him." So then my uncle replied "I'm gonna kill you right now." Then my uncle said "On second thought, I'm tired. I've been in too many fights in my life. I have work tomorrow. You're not worth my time. Goodbye."</p>

<h1>My Anxiety</h1>
<p>Let me reiterate this. During the party, my latino neighbor was saying disgusting vile things about my own mother. I was shocked. I went around my whole family and said "This man is crazy. He literally is my neighbor. It's been years since we finally see or talk to this man. And this is what he finally tells us? That's not right. Normal people are nice at first, and then the craziness comes out once you get to know them. This man revealed his craziness on the first impression. Can you even imagine how crazy he is once you actually get to know him? Why is everyone acting like this man is normal and everything is fine? The school counselor said that kid was being abused by his mother. But I heard no mention of anything about his father. I really wasn't sure what to believe about him. I had no proof that he was crazy, only speculation. But now I have proof. This man should be in prison." Literally, noone in my family cared about what I had to say. They just ignored me.</p>

<h1>Cigarettes</h1>
<p>About one year after the party, I was walking a dog when I saw my nieghbor's kid. He started talking to me. He was very intelligent. He said "I love Marvel comics. The creator Stan Lee recently died. I often visit my school's library to read the Marvel comics there." I asked the kid "What is that on your legs?" He replied "I am certain you heard about my mother moving to Mexico. My parents were both crazy. Whenever I misbehaved, and my father doesn't do this anymore, but he used to burn me with his cigarettes on my legs." I replied "Why do you wear shorts when you have scars on your legs." He said "Because it happened a long time ago. Those scars are fading. I just like to wear shorts. If anyone asks I just tell them I have mosquitos bites, no one asks me further questions. They don't even notice my legs, literally every kid has scars on their legs from falling on their skateboards." I didn't need to ask him any questions, he just kept on talking and talking and asking me questions about myself until finally he said "And my mother threatened to kill me with a knife, she would tell me that she planned to chop me up into pieces. I was just a kid. That's why I had anger problems, and I was a bully back then. I only have one scar on my leg where my mother cut me with a hot knife." I also learned that he owns an game console, and he likes to play videogames on his phone.</p>

<p>I know you are thinking this is fake. I don't know. Maybe the kid is lying to me. This happened a long time ago, before we found out he was being abused. But one time my step-father and I were walking next to that kid's home, and we heard that kid screaming and crying, and my step-father said to me "Ugh, I hate that stupid kid. He's so nnoying. How old is? And he is still crying like an infant. And he's so disgusting and fat. I hope they are beating his a** so he could stop acting like a baby." One time my sister said "That kid always has wet bugers on his upper lip, I don't want my sons talking to that psychopath." It's so sad how even grown ups outcasted this poor kid. 

<h1>Bullying</h1>
<p>It reminds me of when I was in middle, there was this one kid that everyone hated and they said he was the most annoying person in the school. One time he was talking to me, and I felt embarrassed standing next to him, because then everyone will put me in that same category as him. He kept on talking and talking, I didn't have to ask him any questions, he would just talk a lot. And do you know what he said? He told me that he felt like killing himself because everyone hated him, and he doesn't know why everyone hates him so much. He said he had no friends. He said he purchased a box of chewing gum so he could give it out to people so he could make a friend. Then he gave me a stick of gum. He was very intelligent, smarter than most other students. I don't understand why did everyone hate him.</p>

<p>In High School, everyone hated this one chubby kid. They used to throw backpacks at him everyday and laugh at him. And same thing, one day he talked to me, and I felt embarrassed standing next to him. And the same thing, he kept on talking and talking nonstop, I didn't ask him any questions, he wouldn't stop talking. I learned he likes Naruto, singing, poetry. I remember in middle school one time he got my number somehow, and he was talking nonstop to me on the phone, he said he loved to sing, and he started singing to me some rock music, he was very bad at singing, but he truly believed he was a great singer, he said to me "You don't have to be jealous of me, you will discover your own talent one day." I replied "I play a guitar." He replied "I heard you play that thing once, you're very horrible at it. Keep practicing though. Maybe one day we can start a band together."</p>

<p>Probably the worst bullying I saw, was in middle school. However, I don't know what was happening. My teacher asked me to deliver papers to another teacher. I walked to another classroom with my hallpass. When I walked passed the boy bathroom, I accidentally glanced at something I wasn't supposed to see. I saw a kid was smiling as he was rinsing a bloody knife in the sink. Then I saw was sitting down crying next to the kid with the knife. I really don't know what did I see. I feel like he was being gang intitiated or something. I remember one time in elementary school some kid told me "My brother was initiated into a gang, and they had to attach a car battery to his nipples and private parts." Then, I remember when I was an adult, I was in a public library bathroom, and I saw some kids wrote some weird gang messages on the walls with markers.</p>
