<p class="two">This page is why I have trust issues.</p>

<p class="two">The famous soccer coach Joachim Loew was caught on camera putting his hand in his pants, and then he smelled his hand <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7USaBkHt8o">[1]</a>. Now there's a whole compilation of him smelling his hand, his armpit sweat, and eating his boogers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT83XwFpJvU">[2]</a>. Joachim Loew publicly apologized for his behavior <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NtMpU5mo2U">[3]</a>. In Joachim Loew's team, Lukas Podolski replied <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Se4R0QLz4I">[4]</a> "It's not an issue within the team because I think 80% of you and I scratch our balls from time to time. So everything is fine." This is why I have trust issues about shaking hands with strangers.</p>

<p class="two">Ryan Seacrest made creepy sexual remarks towards Katy Perry <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/ryan-seacrest-katy-perry-comments-american-idol-caught-air-a8352036.html">[2]</a> He said "But you're not a mom yet... wanna talk about it?" He kept finger blasting his pen. Previously, Ryan Seacrest was accused of sexual harrassment at work <a href="https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/ryan-seacrest-sexual-abuse-allegations-stylist-details-1202710460/">[2]</a>, but he claims he is innocent.</p>

<p class="two">Carol Moreira was just trying to do her job, Vin Diesel had other plans, he said "Talk to me baby."<a href="https://youtu.be/yQ9QkFxC0sc?t=288">[1]</a> He said "How am I supposed to sit over here when I am looking at such beauty? Come on guys. She is so beautiful, I am in love. I'm in love with the interviewer <a href="https://youtu.be/yQ9QkFxC0sc?t=441">[2]</a>" He almost kissed her <a href="https://youtu.be/yQ9QkFxC0sc?t=696">[3]</a> I don't know Portuguese but apparently in the beginning Carol Moreira described how uncomfortable she felt.</p>

<p class="two">Oluwatoyin Salau was an ardent supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5UsGk0GDRs">[1]</a>. In the end, Oluwatoyin Salau was raped and murdered by a black man named Aaron Glee Jr. Oluwatoyin Salau was murdered by the same black men whom she was trying to help.</p>

<p class="two">The video is a home invasion caught on nanny cam <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CavkSl2gyc">[1]</a> <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/appellate-division-unpublished/2018/a5132-15.html">[2]</a>. Detective Collin McMillan testified "When I got to the scene this woman's face was beyond recognition. I'd never seen anything like that ever in my life." The four witnesses who testified against Shawn Custis were his daughter, his fiancee, his second girlfriend, and a woman who rejected him. Those four witnesses lead the investigation in Shawn Custis's apartment where police discovered blood stained clothing matching the victim's DNA. While Shawn Custis was detained, Sheriff Ricardo Rickards witnessed Shawn Custis telling detective Alexis Peroso "When this gate opens, I'm going to bash your face in like I did that bitch in Millburn." The nanny cam caught detective Collin McMillan referring to Shawn Custis as a "monkey <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV7G_oTbcco">[3]</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17Oi8eee6NY">[4]</a>," at the time, he did not know about the nanny cam. Shawn Custis's lawyer claimed Shawn Custis must be innocent because the racist detective Collin McMillan obviously planted the victim's blood on Shawn Custis's garment. They gave Shawn Custis a lifetime sentence.<br><br>Sarcasm: And now you see, once again, how systemic racism put another innocent black man in prison. That ungrateful a** b***h white karen is lucky she sleeps comfortably in a home. Meanwhile, all blacks in america are homeless because of employment and housing discrimination.<br><br>During the assault, the victim could not utter a sound. The victim believed if she had screamed, her daughter might have panicked and screamed too, and Shawn Custis might have punched the daughter. The victim remained quiet to protect her children.</p>

<p class="two">Sarcasm: Another racist white karen getting what she deserves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ldywT3HL2Q">[1]</a>.</p>

<p class="two">To be continued...</p>

<p class="two">Alfred Sharpton lived with his single mother in a ghetto neighborhood <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAzoxvJCEKE">[1]</a>, meanwhile, Alfred Sharpton's father lived in a wealthy neighborhood. Alfred Sharpton's father was a slumlord who took advantange of poor black people <a href="https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/politics/national/2004race/5570/">[2]</a>. Alfred Sharpton's father created a Woody Allen situation by marrying Alfred Sharpton's step sister <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edVSQkAN_hw">[3]</a>. Alfred Sharpton spent his entire life searching for a father figure, he thought he found one in James Brown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAzoxvJCEKE">[4]</a>. Don't you think that's sad? The only father figure he had turned out to be a literal psychopath who abuses women. James Brown was arrested for assaulting his wife with a lead pipe, and firing a gun at a car that she was in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQmqcaS5LIM">[5]</a>.</p>
<p class="two">Two examples of black men verbally bullying white women <a href="https://twitter.com/sreed101/status/1278572389144637440">[4]</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/wypipo_h8/status/1275228765941977089">[3]</a>.</p>

<p class="two">Rodney King had children with 3 different women. All of Rodney King's marriages ended in divorce. During 1999, Rodney King was arrested for doing domestic violence <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-nov-30-me-king30-story.html">[9]</a>. On October 2003, Rodney King was arrested because he punched some woman. During 2005, Rodney King was arrested for threatening to kill his wife, and threatening to kill one of his daughters.</p>

<p class="two">Alton sterling was arrested for domestic violence, and was a registered sex offender <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/alton-sterling-arrest-record/">[10]</a>.</p>

<p class="two">George Floyd was arrested for aggravated robbery, he pressed a pistol onto a woman's abdomen <a href="../georgefloyd.html">[11]</a>. There is pornographic video with the "real" George Floyd. I don't know if it's real, but it looks exactly like George Floyd. Google it for yourself. The media never mentions this porn video. What else is the media hiding from us? At this point, George Floyd is a major political figure. I understand how it is irrelevent to his trial. However, if Donald Trump was a pornstar, does the public have the right to know?</p>

<p class="two">In 1962, Jesse Jackson married Jacqueline Brown, they produced 5 offsprings together. Jesse Jackson and Jacqueline Brown were married for 38 years, then in 2001 it was publicly revealed how Jesse Jackson had committed adultery when he impregnated his subordinate co-worker Karin Stanford. Karin Stanford was in love with Jesse Jackson, during 1997 she published an entire book about him <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Boundaries-Reverend-International-American/dp/0791434451/">[2]</a>. In fact the only reason they met is Karin Stanford interviewed him as research for that book. It is clear to me, that Karin Stanford idolized Jesse Jackson, and Jesse Jackson took advantage of that fact. Karin Stanford wrote an essay that provides insight of the affair from her own perspective <a href="https://cnsnews.com/news/article/jesse-jacksons-mistress-claims-blacks-scapegoated-her">[1]</a> <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Because_I_Said_So.html?id=G7X-ONRUeCoC">[2]</a>. When Karin Stanford was a kid, she lived in her mind's fairy tale, but was disillusioned by the harsh facts of life. Karin Stanford wanted a prince charming who could protect her from "wolves at the door," was her metaphor. Jesse Jackson was a man who understood the world's issues and tried to correct them. Karin Stanford naively believed the lies Jesse Jackson told, that he does not love his wife Jacqueline Brown, he only married Jacqueline Brown for political purposes. When Karin Stanford learned she was pregnant with Jesse Jackson's child, Jesse Jackson promised to pay for their child to have life insurance and college education <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0108/17/tl.00.html">[4]</a>. The affair was exposed when Jesse Jackson's employees accused him of misusing public funds to pay Karin Stanford $76,000 <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/02/01/jackson.money/index.html">[4]</a> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-jan-19-mn-14325-story.html">[5]</a>. Although, in reality Karin Stanford only received $36,000 because the payments ceased abruptly when the scandal started. Jesse Jackson's publicist insisted the $76,000 was owed to Karin Stanford due to her employment. That was how Jesse Jackson was acquitted of embezzlement. The moral of that story is whenever you donate to a charity, you never know if that money is benefiting poor communities, or is helping a horny man pay his sugar mamma.<br><br>Karin Stanford who is herself an African-American woman and breast cancer survivor, she criticised blacks who supported Clarence Thomas, Mike Tyson, OJ Simpson, and R Kelly. Karin Stanford spent her whole life defending minorites, but was outcasted by those same minorities simply because she had sex with a man. Karin Stanford became unemployed. She was revoked by the Democratic National Committee. She said the "black establishment" had labeled her a gold digger. Karin Stanford who earned herself a doctoral, because of ethics and principle she never accepted money from tabloids, that all she wanted was for Jesse Jackson to pay child support. In 2012, Jesse Jackson owed $11,694.50 in child support <a href="https://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/jesse-jackson-deadbeat-dad/">[2]</a>.<br><br>In 1984 <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=124046">[3]</a> and 1996 <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=8qw0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT92">[4]</a>, Jacqueline Brown said some quotes that suggests Jesse Jackson perpetrated decades of extra marital affairs, and Jacqueline Brown was fully aware of it, Jacqueline Brown simply preferred living in denial or complicity. In 2020, Jacqueline Brown is still married to Jesse Jackson.<br><br>Jesse Jackson's eldest son named Jesse Jackson Jr. went on to be a successful democratic politician. In 2013, Jesse Jackson Jr. was sentenced to prison for committing embezzlement by spending $750,000 of his campaign funds on luxury clothing for himself to wear <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/chi-jesse-jackson-jr-sandi-jackson-plea-hearings-wednesday-20130219-story.html">[1]</a>. For example, Jesse Jackson Jr. spent $43,350 on one Rolex wrist watch. Jesse Jackson's other son named Jonathan Jackson defended Jesse Jackson Jr. <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/archive/9308647/">[2]</a>. Jonathan Jackson basically said that what Jesse Jackson Jr. did is not the worst thing in the world, because Jesse Jackson Jr. was only stealing money from rich wealthy elites, it's not like he was stealing from the poor, and stealing $750,000 is nothing compared to the trillions white people steal everday from all of us average Americans, and Jesse Jackson Jr. only got caught because of his skin color, white people do white collar crimes all the time but they don't get caught because they have white privilege. While Jesse Jackson Jr. is still in prison, Jesse Jackson Jr. is receiving annually approx $38,400 from the government, and approx $100,000 from worker's compensation, because Jesse Jackson Jr. had conveniently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder immediately around the time when the allegations against him started <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-jesse-jackson-junior-federal-benefits-met-20170222-story.html">[3]</a>.</p>

<p class="two">Chuck Berry was arrested for punching some woman's face <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chuck-berry-farewell-to-the-father-of-rock-118589/">[12]</a>. Chuck Berry installed hidden cameras in the women's restroom of a restaurant that he owned. There was a video of Chuck Berry urinating on a woman, and the same woman defecating on Chuck Berry's face <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=akzvdiyCQ1EC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q&f=false">[13]</a>. Chuck Berry allegedly had sex with a 14 year old runaway prostitute named Janice Escalanti.</p>

<p class="two">The Cuban-American Ray Diaz was raised in a foster home <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSPjf3jqO_Y">[1]</a>. At first glance, Ray Diaz seemed charming. Ray Diaz appeared on the Hulu series "East Los High," and he appeared on Jake Paul's vlogs. In 2019, Ray Diaz was arrested for sexual assault <a href="https://twitter.com/LAPDHQ/status/1149895928242819072">[2]</a>. Ray Diaz's alleged victims are <a href="https://www.instagram.com/landihicks/">Landi Hicks</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/angelicasalek/">Angelica Salek</a>. Below are audio recordings of Ray Diaz verbally tormenting his victims, some includes audio of Ray Diaz slapping women. The audio was from this youtube playlist <a href="raydiaz.html">[3]</a>. The audio is disturbing. To be honest, I don't know if Ray Diaz was ever found guilty. In Ray Diaz's instagram, he is not in jail or prison, he is plainly out here in the free world living his best life. Landi Hicks said "Yeah and the crazy thing is like the Martinez twins and [incoherent] all these people knew that he was treating me like this, and they never did anything. And he also he had two roomates, and they heard him yelling at me all the time, they watched what he made me do, and they did nothing, they said nothing <a href="https://youtu.be/6hukkp9NOTw?t=1442">[4]</a>."</p>
