00:00.000 --> 00:2.252
Can a woman be a journalist?

00:02.975 --> 00:04.351
No, it's dangerous.

00:04.435 --> 00:06.645
Look at the manual.

00:06.729 --> 00:10.524
This happened when a
woman tried to be a journalist.

00:13.694 --> 00:15.446
What about driving a car?

00:15.529 --> 00:17.072
Driving a car!?

00:17.156 --> 00:19.908
This is what happened
when a woman drove a car.

00:22.536 --> 00:24.663
Can a woman ask questions?

00:24.747 --> 00:26.206
Questions?

00:27.958 --> 00:29.501
I think it's dangerous.

00:29.585 --> 00:31.170
Ah.

00:33.412 --> 00:34.621
What are you doing?

00:34.705 --> 00:36.123
We're driving.

00:36.206 --> 00:37.374
Women can drive.

00:37.458 --> 00:39.209
Don't cry.

00:39.293 --> 00:41.211
Don't cry. Don't cry.

00:41.295 --> 00:42.713
- It's okay.
- You can't drive!

00:42.796 --> 00:44.047
You can't drive!

00:44.131 --> 00:45.299
- I can drive. I can.
- You can't drive!

00:45.382 --> 00:46.842
- It's impossible woman to drive!
- No, no.

00:46.925 --> 00:48.302
- This is...
- No, no, no!

00:48.385 --> 00:50.637
- You are a man dressed like a woman.
- No. No.

00:50.721 --> 00:52.222
Help me!

00:52.306 --> 00:54.558
It's a woman driving the car!

00:54.637 --> 00:55.747
I'm Tutar

00:55.747 --> 00:56.623
- Really?
- Nice to meet you, Tutar.

00:56.706 --> 00:58.082
Nice meet you.

00:58.166 --> 00:59.459
Do you drive a car?

00:59.542 --> 01:00.543
- Yes.
- Oh, absolutely.

01:00.627 --> 01:02.045
- Sure.
- More than one.

01:02.128 --> 01:03.546
- More than one.
- Well, not at the same time.

01:03.630 --> 01:06.424
- What?!
- We drive a car. We own cars.

01:07.550 --> 01:10.428
So the mans sometimes tell lies?

01:10.512 --> 01:13.139
Yes. A-A lot.

01:13.223 --> 01:14.849
Hmm.

01:17.035 --> 01:20.205
Look there is a woman driving a car

01:20.205 --> 01:23.041
That is not a woman.
That is Dog the Bounty Hunter.
