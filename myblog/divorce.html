<h1>My Parent's Divorce</h1>
<p>My parents divorced while I was an infant. I don't have any memories of their divorce. Here is everything I know about their divorce.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, I innocently mentioning my father in a sentence, and then my intoxicated mother replied "I pay all the bills, you live underneath my roof. If you love your father so much, why don't you go live with him? Your father was lazy. He never worked. All he did was drink beer and watch television. He used to beat me up everyday. And he owes child support." Sometimes my mother said "Your father cheated on me one time." Other times my mother said "Your father cheated on me two times." Other times my mother said "Your father cheated on me a bunch of times with many different women."</p>

<p>When I was an adult, my father said "Your mother and I divorced, because your mother cheated on me. Your grandmother forced your mother to confess it. I was returning from work when your grandmother caused a dramatic scene by telling your mother "Go ahead, you tell that nice young man what you did." That was how your mother confessed, and I responded by slapping your mother on her face only one time. It was the only time that I ever hit your mother. I then got my revenge by having sex with your uncle's wife, I know it was immature and foolish of me. However, when I got my revenge, your mother and I had not officially broken up. So that must be why your mother thinks I cheated. From my perspective, that marriage was done in the moment I learned your mother had cheated. Let me clarify this, your mother was the one who cheated on me first."</p>

<p>My father continued "Your mother cheated on me by having sex with my bestfriend. After the divorce, for one entire year I was an alcoholic. One night, I was binge drinking with my car parked outside my bestfriend's house, the one who betrayed me. I waited there with brass knuckles on my hands. I waited there so I could break his nose. Luckily for him, I fell asleep. He must have been aware of my presence, because on that same day, he packed his bags, and moved to Mexico. I haven't heard from him ever since. I am not a violent person. I was just young and foolish. I learned from my mistakes."</p>

<p>My father continued "Your mother won custody of you and your sister. I did not fight for custody, because my family told me that children can live without their fathers without any issues, but when a child doesn't have a mother, it creates behavioral issues in that child. I asked an attorney, and he also agreed that mothers are very important. This was a commonly held belief during the 1990s."</p>

<p>My father continued "When I first moved to the United States, I did not understand the English language. Your mother took advantage of my illiteracy. During the divorce, your mother tricked me into forfeiting the deed to our house; she lied and said it was 'divorce papers.' Your mother stole that house from me. So that was why I did not pay child support, because that house was worth more than the child support. And also, I was not lazy. I worked a lot. My contruction career was unstable. Whenever I was unemployed, I worked on projects at home. Some weeks I did not have employment. That must be why your mother thinks I was lazy."</p>

<p>My father continued "During the divorce, one time the police handcuffed me while I was having lunch with your sister at El Pollo Loco. Your mother said to me 'If you ever kidnap my daughter again, I am going to report you for molestation, no one will believe you, because you barely know English.'"</p>

<p>My cousin who witnessed my parent's divorce said "I don't know who cheated first. However, your father is not being completely honest. I don't know what happened behind closed doors between you and your father. Your father was not known for being abusive. It's probably true that your father only hit your mother only one time. However, I was there when it happened. I saw it with my own two eyes. And it was more than just one slap. Your father went off on your mother. Your father grabbed your mother's hair in front of all of us. Your father dragged your mother into the bathroom, he locked the bathroom door. I heard your mother screaming. Then, your father left. And I had to clean the blood on the bathroom."</p>

<p>My step-great-grandfather said "I don't know who cheated first. All I know is if your mother finds out I am telling you this, she will evict me. I only know what I saw. Here is what I saw. One time your father was parked outside, your father was attempting to visit his children, on this particular day, your father was not causing any problems, he was calm and relaxed. But then your mother grabbed a huge brick and threw it at your father's car, and your father's window shattered. Don't ask any more questions. I don't want to be involved."</p>

<p>When I was an adult, finally, I asked my intoxicated mother "Who cheated first? You or my father?" My intoxicated mother replied "One night I had a dream that my friend died from a car accident. Then one week later my friend died from a real car accident. One night I had a dream that I was pregnant with a boy. Then 9 months later I held you in my arms. I inherited this curse from my grandmother that my dreams always come true. My dreams predict the future. Before our divorce, one night I had a dream that your father was cheating on me with our neighbor Rosa. I didn't want to believe my dream was true. Then one night during sex, your father accidentally called me by the name Rosa. That was how I knew my dream was true. That was why I cheated first. Now all these years later, I am now married to a new person, but your father is now married Rosa; all because of my clairvoyance." It's true. My father is now married to the same Rosa.</p>
