<p>This is a very crazy and long story, it's gonna take a long time to write it. These are drafts.</p>

<h1>How John and Jane Met</h1>
<p>In the beginning, Jane and John were publicly video chatting eachother on a livestreaming app. That was how I learned about this story. Jane was drinking alcohol while announcing to the viewers "This is my friend named John. When I was 8 years old, John was also 8 years old with me, but when we turned 9 years old he changed houses, now almost 20 years later John and I reunited through this app! It was a beautiful accident!" John was drinking alcohol and replied "Jane, I am so happy. You are the most beautiful woman in the world. You are very gorgeous." Jane replied "I am fat and hideous." John replied "Stop it, don't say hurtful things about yourself. You are perfect to me." John continued "While I was in my military training, our lieutenant constantly made us stay awake up to 4 days in a row. We were sleep deprived. It made me paranoid but mentally rigid." John continued "I want to go on a romantic date with you Jane, I want to be with you underneath the stars of Yosemite." Jane replied "I hate nature. Do they have wifi in Yosemite? I might want to try glamping." John replied "I love nature, wilderness, the great outdoors. When I was a kid, with my father I enjoyed hunting animals. There is no wifi in Yosemite, but we will have eachother, and that is the beauty." Jane replied "Please don't hunt animals, I love animals." Several weeks later, Jane and John were officially monogamous, boyfriend and girlfriend.</p>

<p>John turned out to be a complete and utter psychopath. Jane and I messaged eachother, and we combined our terrifying stories together. This is what happened.<p>

<h1>Love Bombing</h1>
<p>Jane and John had a relationship where they would constantly break up and get back together again. When they were broken up John said "I am going to kill myself. I lost the love of my life. Everything is my fault." When they reunited John said "I am so happy, I have the best girlfriend in the whole entire world. Jane is my whole entire universe. I found my soulmate."</p>


<h1>John's Suicide Attempt</h1>
<p>As I watched Jane's livestreams, a random user suddenly commented "John drank a bottle of sleeping pills, I think he is dead." Jane ignored that comment. I said to myself "Did Jane's boyfriend attempt suicide? It must be the wrong John." So the next time I saw Jane's boyfriend John was online, I joined John's livestream. John is very unpopular on the app, I was the only one watching him. It was night time, there was John drinking alcohol while seated on the carpeted floor. John said to me "I lived a hard life, experienced so much pain and hardships. There is only one person who could stop me, but she doesn't care about me. I don't want my life story to be remembered. I'd rather be forgotten forever as if I never existed. Ever since I was a teenager I wanted to die, today is the day. This rifle combined with this bullet guarantees my death."

<p>As John continued drinking alcohol, his rhetoric turned creepier and creepier. John said "Jovanny, you're my only friend. I want to confess a secret. You must promise to never tell anyone especially Jane. You cannot tell Jane. Promise me you will never speak of this ever again." I replied "Stop acting weird, it's not a big deal, just say it." I argued with John until finally I replied "Your life is valuable to me. I promise." Just replied "My secret is... Jane broke up with me." So that explains why he wanted to kill himself. John drunkedly said "Anyways, goodnight I am falling asleep."</p>

<h1>Psycho</h1>
<p>After witnessing John's suicidal episode, I started to watch John's livestreams everyday. John was the nicest person to me. John was singing cheesy break

<h1>Fake Profile</h1>

<p>Jane told me "A mysterious man named Scott messaged me on Instagram. Scott asked me if I had a boyfriend. I replied to Scott 'I am currently in a monagamous relationship with someone. I intend to be faithful to him.' John messaged me about groceries, then suddenly Scott messaged me about groceries too. I began volunteering at an animal shelter, only John knew this about me, suddenly Scott was talking about animal shelters. It was so obvious that Scott is John's fake profile. I confronted John. John replied 'I'm not Scott. I can prove it. Facetime me right now. Look you see, I am at work, I am in my uniform. Anyways, I gotta get back to work.' I broke up with John. John replied 'I apologize, and confess to everything. I created Scott because I have trust issues due to my exgirlfriend who cheated on me. I was testing your faithfulness to me. I have insecurities that I need to work on.' John and I got back together.</p> 

<h1>Another Fake Profile</h1>
<p>As I watched Jane's livestreams, a random user suddenly commented "Jovanny, I am new to this app, but I saw a livestreamer named John, and John is about to kill himself. I tried to talk him out of it, but he blocked me. Please, his face looks like a skeleton, he has a rope around his neck." Immediately, I joined John's livestreams and there was John staring at the camera with a creepy smile on his face, he said "Hello Jovanny." Suddenly, John's smile turned to a frown. I asked "Why do you have a rope?" John replied "Because I'm thinking about suicide. I can't live without Jane. Jane is gone from my life. I haven't eaten. In 6 days, I had 4 hours of sleep. I vomit 3 times today. I lost so much weight, look at my stomach. Look at my face, my face looks like a skeleton! I'm lovesick." That was how I realized John created a fake account. The random user said "His face looks like a skeleton." Suddenly, John said "my face looks like a skeleton."</p> 

John started calling my phone 50 times per day. I broke up with John again. John replied "I promise I'll stop calling your phone so much." We got back together, but John continued to call my phone 50 times per day. I broke up with him again, but this time I blocked him on all social media. If John can't make this small sacrifice for me, I can't trust him. John is obsessed with the idea that I could be cheating on him. I believe deep down John wants me to cheat on him. That is what he truly wants. And there is something weird about John's sexual habits but I don't feel comfortable talking about it Jovanny. John is a giver, but he does not want to receive."

<p>I replied to Jane "Based on the evidence, it sounds like John receives sexual gratification from being a cuckhold. But it has to be real cheating. It sounds like he is faking orgasms or has erectile dysfunction. Maybe the only way he can orgasm is through some weird fucked up sexual fantasy that he needs to trap you in a relationship first before he propositions you."</p>

<p>Jane replied "John is amazing at sex. He always makes me orgasm. No other person has made me orgasm better than John. John understands the female anatomy. But John does not want to receive sex from me. I am uncertain about the cuckholdry hypothesis. But you are correct about one thing Jovanny, John is defintely doing his best to trap me in a relationship. But I have this feeling like he doesn't love me. He is just using me like an object. And I kind of love it. I am so madly in love with John. I am thinking about getting back together with John again." 

<h1>Jane's Stories</h1>
<p>Jane told several concerning stories: She said "In the past, I had a stalker who would look through my windows." and "I was at the Shopping Centre with a group of friends, there I made a fart reference, and one male friend immediately slapped me very hard on my face and yelled at me 'Shut the fuck up, you are a woman, women shouldn't talk about farts, you filthy whore.'" and "In the same Shopping Centre but in the food court area, there my male friend told me 'You failed the simple task of ordering food, you're god damned fucking stupid.' The woman behind me told me "Don't let any man talk to you like that. Please find help. Leave him." and "An exboyfriend broke into my house at night, and while I was sleeping, he jumped on top of me and started punching and biting me. I have pyhsical scars on me now." and "An exboyfriend showed up at my work and caused a dramtic scene. I almost lost my job." and "An exboyfriend wanted sex, I told him I didn't want sex, he pushed me, he punched me, and he forced me to have sex, I told him to stop, he didn't stop. I froze. I didn't try to fight back. I am uncertain if I was raped because I didn't fight back but he was my boyfriend." and "I don't enjoy romantic sex, I enjoy rough sex. I broke up with so many different guys because they did not give me the rough sex that I wanted. One time I commanded a man to fuck me harder, and he looked at me awkwardly, he asked "Are you sure?" and then he punched me. That's not what I meant by rough sex. And that was the awkwardest moment in my life."</p>
