<p>This is a very crazy and long story, it's gonna take a long time to write it. These are drafts.</p>

<p>In the beginning, Jane was livestream video chatting with a man named John. Jane said "This is my friend named John. When I was 8 years old, John was also 8 years old with me, but when we turned 9 years old he changed houses, now almost 20 years later John and I reunited through this app! It was a beautiful accident!" John was drinking alcohol and replied "Jane, I am so happy. You are the most beautiful woman in the world. You are very gorgeous." Jane replied "I am fat and hideous." John replied "Stop it, don't say hurtful things about yourself. You are perfect to me." John continued "When I was in the military training, our lieutenant constantly made us stay awake up to 4 days in a row. We were sleep deprived. It made me paranoid but mentally rigid." John continued "I want to go on a romantic date with you Jane, I want to be with you underneath the stars of Yosemite."</p>
