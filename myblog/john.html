<p>This is a very crazy and long story, it's gonna take a long time to write it. These are drafts.</p>

<h1>How John and Jane Met</h1>
<p>In the beginning, Jane and John were publicly video chatting eachother on a livestreaming app. That was how I learned about this story. Jane announced to her viewers "This is my friend named John. When I was 8 years old, John was also 8 years old with me, but when we turned 9 years old he changed houses, now almost 20 years later John and I reunited through this app! It was a beautiful accident!" John was drinking alcohol and replied "Jane, I am so happy. You are the most beautiful woman in the world. You are very gorgeous." Jane replied "I am fat and hideous." John replied "Stop it, don't say hurtful things about yourself. You are perfect to me." John continued "While I was in my military training, our lieutenant constantly made us stay awake up to 4 days in a row. We were sleep deprived. It made me paranoid but mentally rigid." John continued "I want to go on a romantic date with you Jane, I want to be with you underneath the stars of Yosemite." Jane replied "I hate nature. Do they have wifi in Yosemite? I might want to try glamping." John replied "I love nature, wilderness, the great outdoors. When I was a kid, with my father I enjoyed hunting animals. There is no wifi in Yosemite, but we will have eachother, and that is the beauty." Jane replied "Please don't hunt animals, I love animals." Several weeks later, Jane and John were officially monogamous, boyfriend and girlfriend.</p>



<h1>Jane's Stories</h1>
<p>Jane told several concerning stories: She said "In the past, I had a stalker who would look through my windows." and "I was at the Shopping Centre with a group of friends, there I made a fart reference, and one male friend immediately slapped me very hard on my face and yelled at me 'Shut the fuck up, you are a woman, woman shouldn't talk about farts, you filthy whore.'" and "In the same Shopping Centre but in the food court area, there my male friend told me 'You failed the simple task of ordering food, you're god damned fucking stupid.' The woman behind me told me "Don't let any man talk to you like that. Please find help. Leave him." and "An exboyfriend broke into my house at night, and while I was sleeping, he jumped on top of me and started punching and biting me. I have pyhsical scars on me now." and "An exboyfriend showed up at my work and caused a dramtic scene. I almost lost my job." and "An exboyfriend wanted sex, I told him I didn't want sex, he pushed me, he punched me, and he forced me to have sex, I told him to stop, he didn't stop. I froze. I didn't try to fight back. I am uncertain if I was raped because I didn't fight back but he was my boyfriend." and "I don't enjoy romantic sex, I enjoy rough sex. I broke up with so many different guys because they did not give me the rough sex that I wanted. One time I commanded a man to fuck me harder, and he looked around all awkwardly, he asked "Are you sure?" and then he punched me. That's not what I meant by rough sex. And that was the awkwardest moment in my life."</p>
