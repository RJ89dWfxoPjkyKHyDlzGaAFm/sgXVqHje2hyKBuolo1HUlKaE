<p>My sister is the #1 reason why I am disgusted by the Black Lives Matter movement. So here goes her story. It's not just my sister, it's her boyfriend, it's all their friends. All of them openly say things like "I hate all white people."</p>

<h1>Running Away</h1>
<p>My sister's first son had gradually developed anger issues over the years. Even before Henry had molested him, he was seeing a therapist for anger management, and his parents purchased anger management books for him to read. When he was 9 years old, he finally asked his parents "Is he my real dad?" And his parents finally told the partial truth. Suddenly, he realized that his parents had lied to him about his origins, and he wondered what other lies they told him. A few weeks later, he was in a verbal argument with his parents, which he told me about it, he said {paraphrase} "My parents always punish me, but they never punish my brother. My brother does whatever he wants and my parents allow it. That is what I argued. My parents told me I was grounded, not allowed to play videogames anymore, so I argued against their unfair punishments. My mother replied "Don't question my authority! Because I say so!" And I started yelling and crying, and they were yelling at me, so I told them I am going to run away. And my step-father replied "Go ahead, you'll never do it. You're weak." And so I ran away from home."</p>

<p>So then, they found my sister's first son as he was laying down on a piece of cardboard outside a grocery store. My sister's first son reflected on his feelings, he said "Nothing in the world mattered anymore. I just wanted to lay down and die."</p>


<h1>Hipocrisy</h1>
<p>My sister worships the black lives matter movement, and she hates nazis. The irony is she abuses her first child because of his genetics. Basically, my sister is afraid that one day her first son will become like his gangster latino father.</p>

<p>For a while my sister was forcing her first son to take piano lessons. One day, he threw a tantrum because he did not want to be in piano lessons. So my sister hardcore beat him up. He was just a kid probably like 6 years old.</p>

<p>One day, my sister's first son drew a mustache and unibrow on himself with washable crayola markers. He said "Haha mommy look at my funny mustache and unibrow." So my sister hardcore beat him up because it reminded her of the gangster face tattoos his father had. And the worst part is my sister has huge tattoos all over her own body!</p>

<p>My sister hates the police so much. The irony is she is more afraid of her exboyfriends than the cops. Literally, she is terrified because her exboyfriend is coming out of prison soon, and he might kill her.</p>

<h1>Violent Party</h1>
<p>All throughout the coronavirus pandemic, my sister went to parties. Here's what my sister's first son told me, he was 9 years old and this is what he told me, I am paraphrasing so it makes more sense to my readers, he said "During the pandemic, my sister took me to many different parties. In one specific party, my step-father's friend was choking another man. One man kicked chairs and tables and started yelling at his girlfriend. The man yelling at his girlfriend was the most concerning thing to me. The situation got so bad. I thought someone was going to pull out a gun and start killing people. So I grabbed all the children and I pushed them to go inside a dog house. I stood in front of the dog house door to protect the children, I believed that I was going to die for them. My mother grabbed me, and my brother, and together we all ran to our car."</p>

<h1>Thanksgiving</h1>
<p>Several days before Thanksgiving 2020, my sister and her boyfriend went out and partied it up at Las Vegas, Nevada. When they returned, my sister's boyfriend was diagnosed with coronavirus. He was asymptomatic. He did not care that he had coronavirus, because on Thanksgiving Day my sister and her boyfriend visited their distant relatives. When they returned, my sister's first son said to me, I am paraphrasing for my readers, he said to me "My father's sister's boyfriend is named Henry. Henry is an adult latino man. Henry was arguing with his step-child about a bicycle. The step-child slammed a door in retaliation of Henry. The door slamming invited a larger argument among the other adults. Everyone was arguing. Then, Henry grabbed his girlfriend's car keys, and angrily drove away with her car (Henry stole his girlfriend's car). They called the police to report the stolen vehicle. When the police arrived, everyone started telling their stories about Henry. Two of Henry's step-children told the police that Henry had an extensive history of choking them. All three of Henry's step-children told the police that Henry had an extensive history of sexual molestation. One of Henry's step-children, said that her bathroom door handle had remained broken since the longest time, so while she was taking a shower, Henry walked in and said to her "Let me teach you how to bathe herself," and that was how Henry molested her. When the police left, Henry's girlfriend yelled at everyone and told us all to leave. Henry's girlfriend was angry because she had protected Henry, and now she might go to prison as an accomplice. She knew about everything, the abuse and molestation, she knew about all of it. She simply did not care. She loved Henry. She did not want him to leave." 

<p>So then I replied to my sister's first son "Did Henry do anything to you?" And my sister's first son said to me "Recently, my mother took me to swim in a river. Henry was there. I was splashing water on him. And Henry told me "Do that one more time, and watch what will happen next. I'm warning you to stop spashing water on me." And I did not listen to Henry's warning. I splashed him again. And immediately Henry submerged himself underneath the water. For a few seconds I didn't see him. Then, suddenly I felt something pull my shorts and underwear down, and it was Henry, and he started touching my private parts." Then, my mother interrupted my sister's first son by saying to him "No. That's not what you told me." I yelled at my mother "Shut the f**k up, you're always in denial. He said what he said." So basically, my sister's first son had told his parents "Henry pulled my pants and underwear down..." Then they interrogated my sister's first son, as if my sister's first son was about to be punished if he responds incorrectly, if you don't already know my sister's first son gets beat up for nearly anything, so my sister's first son changed his story and said "Henry pulled my pants down... but it was a funny prank he played on me." So then I asked him "If you knew that Henry was bad, why were you excited to visit his house on Thanksgiving." He replied "I'm very extroverted, I just wanted to laugh and play games with the other children."</p>

<p>Finally, my sister's first son said "My mother said I am not allowed to speak about what happened to me, because no one here is qualified to give me advice. I was supposed to keep this a secret. But I had to tell someone."</p>

<p>So then my sister installed a houshold security camera system because she is paranoid that Henry is going to seek revenge. My sister and her boyfriend reported Henry and his girlfriend to social services. And then my aunt told me "Henry's girlfriend has a history of abusive relationships. All three of her children are from different fathers. And she has protected all of her abusive boyfriends. At one point, she lived in a public housing for domestic violence survivors. She lived there with her boyfriend who was actively abusing her. She went against the welfare terms, by using her public housing to house her abuser. Recently, her mother died while jay walking at night, and now they are trying to sue the hospital for malpractice."</p>

<p>And this story does not end here. There's so much more. But I will continue later.</p>
