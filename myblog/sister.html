<p>My sister is the #1 reason why I am disgusted by the Black Lives Matter movement. So here goes her story. It's not just my sister, it's her boyfriend, it's all their friends. All of them openly say things like "I hate all white people. All white people are inherently evil." My sister worships the black lives matter movement. Ever since she was a teenager, she has been saying "F**k the police, I hate pigs." Ever since my sister went to college, she has been spewing out evidence based hatred against white people. Unfortunately, I do not live with my sister, so I am mostly oblivious to my sister's barbaric parenting methods. Over the years, I was able to hear about these stories. I am sorry if all of these stories are confusing to understand.</p>

<h1>Running Away</h1>
<p>My sister's first son had gradually developed anger issues over the years. He was seeing a therapist for anger management, and his parents purchased anger management books for him to read. When he was 9 years old, he finally asked his parents "Is he my real father?" His step-father replied "No, I am your step-father." My sister cried that week. My sister's first son said to me "I always knew he wasn't my real father, because as a kid, I remember my mother lived by herself, then suddenly one day there was a stranger in our home, which my mother refered to as "your dad." A few days later, he was in a verbal argument with his parents, which he told me about it, he said {paraphrase} "My parents always punish me, but they never punish my brother. My brother does whatever he wants and my parents allow it. My brother has stolen money from my mother's purse, he didn't get grounded for it. Meanwhile, I get spanked for asking a bad question to my parents like on this particular day, my parents grounded me, I was not allowed to play videogames, I asked them why won't they ever punish my brother. My mother replied "Because I say so!" It made me cry aloud, I told them I would run away from home. My step-father replied "Go ahead, you'll never do it. You're weak." My step-father challenged me to run away from home, and so I ran away from home. One hour later, my relatives found me, as I was laying down on a piece of cardboard outside a grocery store. When I returned home, my mother said "Stop being a spoiled brat, stop running away, you're an embarrassment, you're grounded for 6 weeks now, no more videogames, no more Tik-Tok, no more Youtube." When my parent's were gone, my younger brother taunted me "Haha, you should have run away even further than that, you're weak. If you're gonna run away, atleast do it right, run and don't come back, next time." A relative asked my sister's first son "How did you feel when you were gone? Were you afraid of being lost forever?" My sister's first son replied "Like nothing in this world mattered to me anymore. I would close my eyes and vanish like the bible said "from dust we came and to dust we return."</p>

<h1>Thanksgiving</h1>
<p>Few days before Thanksgiving 2020, my sister and her boyfriend went out and partied it up at Las Vegas, Nevada. When they returned, my sister's boyfriend was diagnosed with coronavirus. He was asymptomatic. He did not care that he had coronavirus, because on Thanksgiving Day my sister and her boyfriend traveled 70 miles to their distant relatives. Upon their return, my sister's first son said to me, I am paraphrasing for my readers, he said to me "My father's sister's boyfriend is named Henry. Henry is an adult latino man of approximately 34 years old. Henry was arguing with his step-child about a bicycle. The step-child slammed a door in retaliation of Henry. The slamming door noise incited a larger argument among the other adults. Everyone was arguing. Then, Henry grabbed his girlfriend's car keys, and angrily drove away with her car (Henry stole his girlfriend's car). They called the police to report the stolen vehicle. When the police arrived, everyone told the police their stories about Henry. Their combined stories was that Henry molested all three of his step-children, and regularly choked two of his step-sons. Henry's step-daughter said her bathroom door handle had remained broken since the longest time, so while she showered, Henry walked in and said "Let me teach you how to bathe herself," and that was how Henry molested her. When the police left, Henry's girlfriend yelled at everyone and told us all to leave. Henry's girlfriend knew about everything, the abuse and molestation, she knew about all of it. She simply did not care. She loved Henry. She did not want Henry to leave."</p> 

<p>So then I replied to my sister's first son "Did Henry do anything to you?" And my sister's first son said to me "Recently, my mother took me to swim in a river. Henry was there. I was splashing water on him. And Henry told me "Do that one more time, and watch what will happen next. I'm warning you to stop spashing water on me." I did not listen to Henry's warning. I splashed him again. Immediately, Henry submerged himself underneath the water. A few seconds I didn't see him. Suddenly, I felt something pull my shorts and underwear down, and it was Henry, and he touched my private parts." Then, my mother interrupted my sister's first son by saying to him "No. That's not what you told me." I yelled at my mother "Shut up, you're always in denial. He said what he said." So basically, he once told his parents "Henry pulled my pants and underwear down..." They interrogated my sister's first son, as if my sister's first son was about to be punished if he responds incorrectly, if you don't already know my sister's first son gets beat up for nearly anything, so my sister's first son changed his story and said "Henry pulled my pants down... but it was a funny prank he played on me." So then I asked him "If you knew that Henry was bad, why were you excited to visit his house on Thanksgiving." He replied "I'm very extroverted, I just wanted to laugh and play games with the other children." Finally, my sister's first son said "My mother said I am not allowed to speak about what happened to me, because no one here is qualified to give advice. I was supposed to keep this a secret. But I had to tell someone."</p>

<p>My sister and her boyfriend reported Henry and his girlfriend to social services. Then my sister installed a security camera system because she is paranoid that Henry might seek revenge.  My aunt told me "Henry's girlfriend has a history of abusive relationships. All three of her children are from different fathers. And she has protected all of her abusive boyfriends. At one point, she lived in a public housing for domestic violence survivors. She lived there with her boyfriend who was actively abusing her. Also, her mother died recently while jay walking at night, and now they are trying to sue the hospital for malpractice."</p>

<h1>Psychiatric Hospital</h1>
<p>During December 2020, my relatives told me "Your sister's first son was banging his head on the wall, an ambulance was called. He is now temporarily living in a psychiatric ward for children."</p>

<p>During a phone conversation, my sister's first son said to his brother "Hi brother, I am not going to be home for a couple days. I am in therapy. I will be better soon. They are going to fix me. I am not going to be mean to you anymore. I love you brother." I believe it was about one week he lived in the psychiatric ward. When he returned home he said to me "It was a prison for children. In the hospital, I got very angry and I started banging my head on the table." I replied "Why were you doing that?" He replied "Because they failed understand me. That is a non issue compared to what happens next. A kid who was a patient there, he pulled my pants down and he touched my private parts. I reported him to the employees, but the employees refused to believe me. Immediately, another kid went forward which corroborated our victimizations. He confessed that same kid touched his private parts too. Suddenly, the kid who touched us became angry, all three of us were angry, we were running around like lunatics, at one point I punched a wall. So then a doctor chased after us, the doctor pulled my pants down and injected my butt with a needle containing a drug. Suddenly, I heard a ringing noise in my hear, I was hallucinating. My life turned into a video game simulation. I failed to sleep because of that ringing noise in my ear. I am still feeling the effects of the drug right now. My parents barely picked me up from there." The ringing noise he heard was probably his tinnitus, he diagnosed as hearing impaired, and vision impaired. I felt sorry asking him this, but I had to better understand this hospital, how does one explain racism to a kid? I asked him "The kid who touched your private parts, how did he look? What color was his skin?" He replied "He was obviously a mexican like me."</p>

<p>His eyes were all woozy, he was clearly on a drug. His great-aunt said "We took him to a sporting supply store. He warned us about a guy who was purchasing a gun, he warned us this guy might follow us home, and he warned us this guy might kill us. He was paranoid." When he returned from the sporting supply store, he said "I never told anyone about this, but ever since I was a kid I battled with depression. My depression is why I lost interest in art and dancing. I don't want to live anymore." Another thing I noticed when he returned from the hospital, all of a sudden he was speaking a new ghetto language he was saying things like "My shoes are tight yo, I'mma be so fresh in these laces."</p>

<h1>Manic Episode</h1>
<p>The doctors recommended a medication called Lithium. My sister and her boyfriend are against medications on children, so they purchased CBD gummy bears instead of Lithium. When their first son was released from the hospital, my sister immediately gave their first son two CBD gummy bears. 24 hours later, their first son was screaming because his stomach was hurting. He was frequently urinating. It seemed he was having a drug induced manic episode. He screamed out loud "Please, I don't want to go back. It was traumatic when the doctor injected my butt, he was a stranger looking at my naked butt. My stomach hurts. This is torture." He was screaming and crying for about one hour. My aunt found the bag of CBD gummy bears and confronted my sister and my sister's boyfriend by saying "Are you giving marijuana to your son?" My sister's boyfriend replied "You're f**king stupid. It's not marijuana. It's called CBD. It's perfectly safe, legal, and natural. It has no effects on your mind. Shut up. Don't speak on things you are ignorant about." So then I googled CBD and learned it has drug interactions, specifically CBD slows the metabolism of most medications. I never told them what I read about CBD. My sister said "What was the last thing you ate?" Suddenly, their first son said "It wasn't the cereal I ate. Mommy, I started feeling like this ever since you gave me those gummy bears." His step-father commented "His stomach doesn't hurt. He is merely a spoiled brat." My sister said the doctor injected him, she said "I believe it was Thorazine with the letter D, something like that."</p>

<h1>Sue the Hospital</h1>
<p>Immediately, my sister and her boyfriend attempted to sue the children's hospital, my sister's boyfriend said "I am suing them because we did not consent to the drugs they injected our first son with." My aunt replied "His manic episode was probably caused by the CBD you gave him." My sister's boyfriend replied "Shut up, they won't know that. Anyways, I have video evidence of his manic episode." I told my mother "That's not fair how they would give free money to very bad people like my sister and her boyfriend." My mother replied "Your sister is a conartist exactly like your father. She is my daughter, which means I love her despite her conartistry. Well, theres nothing we can do. That's good they are going to make a lot of money if they succeed."</p>

<h1>Aggression</h1>
<p>After what happened to my sister's first son, I recently saw him again, he is still 9 years old but seems very irritable. I saw him grab his brother by the shirt, pinch his forearm, and say to him "Shut the fuck up, I am going to kill you. How many times do I have to tell you to leave me alone already? I'm going to kill you. I'm going to tell our mom that you were watching naked girls on the internet Haha" Then he pushed his brother, and his brother landed safetly on the couch behind him. My sister's first son started seeing a therapist, he told his therapist that he thinks about killing himself. The therapist told my sister, and my sister told my mother. And my mother angrily said "He was never suicidal until that therapist asked him questions. Therapy is more harm than good. That psychologist implanted those ideas into his mind." Everyone in my family was astonished to learn he was suicidal, except me. I already knew. He told me already. If you talk to him, he gives hints about suicide. The adults in my family ignore the signs, because they think he is stupid because of his age.</p>

<h1>In the Past</h1>
<p>Below here I am going to describe the stories in the past that lead up to that point where my sister's first son at 9 years old is threatening to kill people, threatening to kill himself, and banging his head on the walls. Despite all the stories, in my honest opinion, I think it all started when my sister purchased a skateboard without a helmet for him. My sister's first son is the wimpiest kid ever but he tries to be tough because his parents bully him. For example, one day my sister's first son accidentally cut his leg, when he witnessed his own blood he fainted. My sister's first son was 9 years old when he told me "My step-father forces me to watch gore movies so I can stop being weak minded. He says I faint at the sight of blood because I am weak minded." For example, when my sister's first son was 7 years old, he wanted light up Sketchers shoes. My sister told him "Ew! You look ugly. Those shoes are ugly! You should choose Nike or Adidas." He replied "I really like these Sketchers shoes." My aunt was there and said "Don't buy him those red nike shoes. That color is associated with a gang called bloods." My sister told her son "Don't listen to her, the real gangs are the police." Ever since then, my sister's first son has been obsessed about what clothes he wears, he is obsessed with trying to be cool. So that is why he wanted a skateboard, so he can stop being a wimp. So like I said they didn't buy him a helmet. So one day he was riding his skateboard, he fell down and the back of his head hit the concrete, he went unconscious. In my opinion, ever since then, that is when his anger issues and head banging began. Dr. Daniel Amen said "And very few people know that the trouble they have in life is related to a head injury that happened years ago <a href="https://youtu.be/eY-jGedHMzE?t=573">[1]</a>."</p>


<h1>Tattoos</h1>
<p>When my sister's first son was 6 years old, he drew a mustache and unibrow on himself with washable crayola markers. He said "Haha mommy look at my funny mustache and unibrow." So then my sister beat him up because it reminded her of the face tattoos his biological father had. And the worst part is my sister has tattoos on her own body. She has an enormous lower back tattoo, and I was told that she may have other tattoos. My sister's current boyfriend, I have seen the tattoos spanning his chest and upper shoulders. Basically my sister is harsh and aggressive against her first son to prevent him from being a gangmember like his imprisoned latino father. That is why my sister always punishes her first son, and never punishes her second son. Also, because her second son is blood related to her current boyfriend. For example, when my sister's first son was 7 years old, she enrolled her first son into piano lessons. He threw a tantrum because he did not want to be in piano lessons. So my sister beat him up. I was told that my sister "went all out" and beat him up "as if he were another adult."</p>

<h1>The Bubble Boy</h1>
<p>When my sister's first son was 8 years old, during Christmas season, my sister went on a vacation to a snowy cabin. My sister invited other people. I was told that my sister in the snowy cabin she announced to all the children "Okay children, it's time for bedtime. Please put away your electronics. Good night." Momentarily later, my sister's first son snuck out of his bedroom and he told his great-aunt "My mother said to put away our electronics. The other kids pretended to put away their electronics, they pretended to fall asleep; but when my mother left, those kids resumed to their electronics. They are not following my mother's advice. And the other kids called me bad names, they told me I should play videogames like the rest of them." So then his great-aunt told him "Remember the bible principles we talked about, the bible teaches us that one bad apple spoils the bunch. The best you can do is distance yourself from bad people. Go back in there, ignore the other kids, and you go to sleep. When you are having more doubts, you should always consult a trustworthy adult, adults have more life experience than you." Then, I am not certain how this happened next but somehow my sister yelled at his great-aunt "What the f**k are you doing? Stop teaching my son about God. So it's all your fault why my son is having behavioral issues. Because you are teaching my son that life is a fairy tale, but that's not how the real world works. I am raising my son to be a man, he must make his own mistakes and learn from them. If you keep treating him like a baby, he'll never leave. He has to move out one day and make his own decisions. Everyone experiences peer pressure and bullying, it's a part of growing up, it builds character. You're teaching my son bad ideas like how to be a snitch, no one wants be friends with a snitch, he will be outcasted, he will be antisocial, he won't have any friends, he will be depressed and suicidal, he'll never leave the house, he'll always be the Bubble Boy afraid of the world. It's all your fault. Everything is your fault. Get the f**k outta my face, stay away from my family."</p>

<h1>Stealing Christmas</h1>
<p>Then, on Christmas day, my sister's first son received a gift card from someone. About a month after christmas day, my sister's first son told me "My mother told me to think carefully about what I want to purchase with my gift card. Then, my mother confiscated my gift card from me. She said when I know what I want to purchase, I should tell her so that she may return my gift card back to me. I waited for this one specific video game to be released soon. When the video game was finally realeased, I told my mother, "Mommy I know what I want to purchase with my gift card, a new videogame!" Then my mother replied "You don't have a gift card anymore. I spent your gift card on myself. Mommy has to take care of herself before she can take care of others. Stop crying, or else you're grounded and I'm gonna spank you. It's your fault because you waited too long. Your brother knew exactly what he wanted, that is why he spent his gift card. Be more like your brother. This is your lessson to stop overthinking everything, the world has no tolerance for slow pokes like you." And what did my sister purchase with the christmas money she stole, she purchased clothes for herself, even though she already has mountains of adidas and nike clothes and shoes.</p>

<h1>Alcoholism</h1>
<p>The first time I ever met my sister's boyfriend, my intuition told me he was an alcoholic. I straight up asked him "Are you an alcoholic?" My sister's boyfriend replied "I'm not addicted to alcohol, I only drink alcohol during holidays and parties." A few weeks later, my sister asked me to install Ikea furniture at her home, 2 bunk beds and 2 computer desks. This was the first time I ever visited my sister's home, low and behold, my sister and her boyfriend were drinking alcohol. I told my sister's boyfriend "I thought you're not addicted to alcohol." He replied "I only drink during weekends." I was there for about 4 days in a row installing one Ikea furniture per day. Every single day I was there my sister and her boyfriend were drinking alcohol. They just sat around drinking alcohol, and my sister said "What the f**k. Why are they charging me for Amazon, HBO, and Hulu. You told me it was a free trial." My sister's boyfriend replied "You're the one who uses those services the most. I forgot to cancel the free trial. It's not a big deal." Each day they seemed to have random visitors in their home. One visitor was a drunken fat woman who said "Jocelyne's boyfriend is an unemployed alcoholic. Jocelyne drunkenly confessed that she only stays with him because he eats her p***y good. She stuck out her tongue to simulate cunnilingus. It was such an embarrassment for Jocelyne because her brother was there. Lorena is still single. Maria has a crazy stalker. And Daniela's boyfriend just got out of prison." All day long that fat woman was gossiping, her butt was glued to that chair, she rarely moved her body, only her mouth was moving nonstop like the Energizer rabbit. Finally, I assembeled one Ikea desk, I exited the bedroom and the fat woman said "Who is that?" My sister replied "That's my younger brother, Jovanny." As I walked away, the fat woman still glued to her chair said "Oh Jovanny, yeah he was friends with Miguel and Jonathan in High School..." I had never seen this woman ever in my life, and somehow she knew everything about me. So then, one day my sister drove through a fire hydrant which exploded. My sister said "I wasn't drunk, just a little hungover. I quit alcohol today. Alcohol is played out, not enjoyable, I quit." The following months my sister continued drinking alcohol, until finally a doctor told her she had to stop drinking alcohol because something was wrong with my her liver. My sister didn't follow her doctor's advice because she continued drinking. My sister already had her appendix removed, and gallblader removed. And that was how my aunt asked my sister's boyfriend "Have you considered what you would do if your girlfriend died?"</p>

<h1>Dramatic</h1>
<p>My aunt asked my sister's boyfriend "Have you considered what you would do if your girlfriend died?" My sister's boyfriend replied "I would take my own son with me, and I will abandon my step-son here with you people. I don't trust you people to take care of my own son. Your family gives preferential to my step-son, so I know he'll be safe here." One day, my sister texted my mother "Mother, can you please take care of my children for me?" My mother replied "I'm very busy and tired. I had a long day of work. The best thing I can do is I can only take care of your first son, because your second son is too young so he cries too much." Then my sister went on a rampage during a group chat to our entire family, she said "I hate my family because you people give preferential to my first son. That's it, I don't need anyone anymore. F**k all of you people. Don't ever talk to me. I'm not celebrating the holidays with my family anymore. I'm deleting all your phone numbers, and blocking all of you." Then, the next day my sister acted normal like nothing happened.</p>

<h1>Intoxicated Driving</h1>
<p>So then my sister's first son told me "My step-father drank alcohol and commanded me to go in the car. I told him it's not safe to drink and drive. My step-father replied "Don't be a scaredy cat. It was just one drink, I'm within the legal limit. Get in the car. It's just around the corner really fast." Then, my step-father struggled to drive around the streets, our car was swerving, my step-father was clearly too drunk. My sister also drives under the influence with her children in the backseat. My relative confronted my sister with "Please, you need to stop drinking and driving with your children in the backseat." My sister replied "Shut the f**k up, I don't care. You think you're so perfect."</p>

<h1>Violent Party</h1>
<p>My sister's first son told me, he was 9 years old and this is what he told me, he said "My sister took us to different parties. One specific party, I will never forget there how my step-father's friend choked someone. Someone else kicked chairs and tables. A man yelling at his girlfriend, pointed a firearm at his girlfriend, threatening to murder her. I grabbed all the children and pushed them towards safety inside a wooden dog house. I stood in front of that dog house entrance to protect the children. In that moment, I envisioned my own death, I truly believed death was near me. My mother grabbed me, and my brother, and together we all ran to our car. Along the way, my mother saw a puppy cowering in a corner amidst the loud music, and comotion. My mother rescued this puppy, carried the puppy to her car and then to our house."</p>

<h1>Racism</h1>
<p>My sister's boyfriend has relatives who are african-american. One african-american child literally beats up my sister's first son. My sister's first son told me "My cousin dragged me against the concrete floor and that was how I got this scab. I told my mother, and she said it was my fault because I was being too bossy, no one wants to be friends with bossy people. My cousin constantly punches me, he says bad words, and bullies me. My great-aunt taught me how to use my vocabulary to express my feelings. So I asked my cousin to please be nicer to me, and I asked him to stop saying bad words. Then my mother yelled at me and said that I was being racist, she commanded me to stop talking to my great-aunt who is teaching me bad ideas." And then my cousin said "He is constantly being punched by his african-american cousin. I think it's great they are teaching him about god and religion. But it's doing him harm. He allows others to bully him. He needs to stand up for himself. I commanded him to punch his cousin back. He said that Jesus teaches us that we should turn the other cheek. He really is the bubble boy. He is going to have problems in the future when he realizes there are more mean people in this world. He needs to stop talking to his great-aunt who is teaching him bad ideas."</p> 

<h1>Oppression</h1>
<p>My sister and her boyfriend are well off. My sister's boyfriend owns a bag full Snap-On branded power tools including hand tools, he has this electric drill that costs $700. They own an entire 7'x7' shed filled with things, tools, lawn mowers, furniture. They own Ray Bans sunglasses, Beats by Dre headphones, mountains of Nike Air Jodan shoes, mountains of Adidas Yeezy shoes. They own mountains of Nike and Adidas clothes. Even their socks are Nike and Adidas. They own 3 High definition televisions. They rent an entire house all to themselves, because they have 2 children. The USDA says it costs $233,610 to raise just one child. They own stacks of video games. One day my sister's first son randomly said to his grandmother "Grandma, can you please buy me the Playstation 4?" I replied "You already have an Xbox." He replied "My dad plays more than me. My dad is on that thing for hours playing Call of Duty, and shouting bad words. I'm not allowed to bother him when he plays. He yells at me. My dad is the one who told me to ask my grandma to buy me a new playstation. He said my grandma is rich. He said to make sure my grandma buys me the Plastation 4 Pro instead of the Playstation Slim." Let me spell this out for you. My sister's boyfriend plays more video games than his own children, and he doesn't want to buy his own children video games. Then he manipulated her son to beg my mother into buy a new Playstation 4 Pro. Literally, that same week my mother told me "Your sister just purchased a brand new car from a dealership." I replied "That is so messed up. They own a brand new car. But they refuse to buy their son a Playstation 4." The point is these people act like they are oppressed but they have literally everything. On google maps, for some weird reason, my sister's house has a party bus on it. I forgot to mention they always own the latest Samsung Galaxy phones, and literally every single day there is a new Amazon shippment at their house. They have opened and unopened Amazon boxes in the kitchen and living room. My sister opens Amazon boxes and says "I forgot I had ordered this." That is what I don't understand. The people who hate capitalism are the ones who use capitalism the most. And the ones who hate cops are also the ones who are doing illegal things. And where did they get all this money from? To be honest, I don't know. I heard my sister's boyfriend was unemployed since the longest amount of time. However, there is one way my sister's boyfriend managed to earn tax-free money. He breeded French Bulldogs.</p>

<h1>Updates</h1>
<p>On February 2021, I was told that the police appeared at my sister's house, there to send my sister's children to a foster home because of the things my sister's first son was telling a therapist. However, the police did not take away my sister's children, because my grandmother signed some papers for the police, and somehow it prevented my sister's children from being taken away. Apparently, my grandmother said to my sister "I'll write you a good review, I'll tell them you're a good mother, but you have to promise me you will change your ways."</p>

<p>I received news that my sister is moving her family to Arizona within 30-60 days. That made me wish to spend time with my sister's first son before he leaves to Arizona. I tried skateboarding with him. The skateboard grip tape ripped a hole into my shoe, but a life is worth more than a pair of shoes. I shared stories about my life with him. I selected these stories because I felt these topics might be relevant to him. I know he has been spending time at the skate park with his grandmother. To me a skatepark is a scary place with many outside influences. I imagined a bully telling him "Why are you wearing a helmet? Take it off, you're f**king gay, a poser, you are." So I asked him "Do you know what is a poser?" I was surprised when he said "A poser is someone who pretends to be a skater, it's not good to be a poser, kids will bully you." I replied "What would you do if someone called you a poser?" He replied "At first I wouldn't care, but if they kept calling me a poser, I would beat them up. I've been in fights before at school. My step-father taught me how to defend myself." I shared a new story, about how in my High School a particular teenager was video recording another student's embarrassing in emotional outburst in class. The student said "Delete the video, or else I'm going to break your phone, and beat your a**." The teenager replied "I can't fight. I'm a pacifist." The student replied "I'm going to pass-a-fist on your face right now." The student punched the teenager's face, and immediately the teenager was knocked unconcious. A video surfaced around the internet of the teenager being knocked out. The teenager was bullied because of that video, and he decided to transfer to a new school because of the bullies. My sisters first son replied "If that happened to me, I wouldn't let anyone bully me, I would beat up the bullies, and become the bully myself. It's better to be a bully than to be a victim." I replied "There are kids who bring a gun to school to kill their bullies. That is what could happen to you, if you keep having that mentality. You might be the kid who brings a gun to school. That's not a good thing." He replied "That's what happened to my (african-american) cousin. Everyone was playing a videogame, on purpose everyone decided to not allow my cousin to play this videogame. Everyone was bullying my cousin. Suddenly, my cousin's words became aggressive, he said "I know where my step-father keeps his gun. Either you're gonna let me play, or I'm gonna take my step-father's gun and I'll kill all of you." The other one replied "You ain't gonna do sh*t." They started throwing punches at eachother." I replied "You need to stop fighting people, there's always going to be someone tougher than you. If you keep fighting, you're going to be expelled from school, you won't be able to graduate, you won't be able to find a job, you're going be stuck living with your crazy mother." He replied "I've been in 4 fights at school."</p>

<p>He said "I think the police were there to send me to jail. I heard them saying things about me. But I couldn't hear them clearly, because my parents sent me to my room." It's not my responsibility to explain things to him, but him plausibly moving to Arizona made me say it, I felt it was the last I will ever see him, I told him that he was almost being sent to a foster home, I explained what is a foster home. I asked him "Did you tell your therapist about the time, you told me, that your step-father was driving while drunk at 106mph, you saw the dashboard meter." He replied "No." I replied "That is a very important detail." He replied "I feel very scared like my father might kill me or hurt me if I told on him. My step-father is unpredictable. I love everyone in my family, I don't want to dissapoint them. Everything that I say to my therapist, my therapist tells my mother. My step-father intimidates me. I am conflicted on whether my step-father is a good person or a bad person. For example, my step-father often gives me great advice, he tells me to never give up, that I should always follow my dreams."</p>

<p>My grandmother said "I am having doubts about whether I made the right decision. When they move to Arizona, I am afraid that woman is going to torture or even murder her own son. I feel like the only thing preventing that woman from seriously harming her son, is the fact she lives with us."</p>
