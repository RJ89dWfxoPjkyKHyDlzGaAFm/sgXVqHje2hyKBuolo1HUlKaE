<p>My sister is the #1 reason why I am disgusted by the Black Lives Matter movement. So here goes her story. It's not just my sister, it's her boyfriend, it's all their friends. All of them openly say things like "I hate all white people. All white people are inherently evil." My sister worships the black lives matter movement. Ever since she was a teenager, she has been saying "F**k the police, I hate pigs." Ever since my sister went to college, she has been spewing out evidence based hatred against white people. Unfortunately, I do not live with my sister, so I am mostly oblivious to my sister's barbaric parenting methods. Over the years, I was able to hear about these stories. I am sorry if all of these stories are confusing to understand.</p>

<h1>Running Away</h1>
<p>My sister's first son had gradually developed anger issues over the years. He was seeing a therapist for anger management, and his parents purchased anger management books for him to read. When he was 9 years old, he finally asked his parents "Is he my real dad?" And his parents finally told him the partial truth. Suddenly, he realized that his parents had lied to him about his origins, and he wondered what other lies they told him. A few weeks later, he was in a verbal argument with his parents, which he told me about it, he said {paraphrase} "My parents always punish me, but they never punish my brother. My brother does whatever he wants and my parents allow it. My brother has stolen money from my mother's purse, and he didn't get grounded for it. But I get spanked for talking back to my parents because I am always forced to clean after my brother's mess. On this particular day, my parents told me I was grounded, not allowed to play videogames anymore, so I argued against their unfair punishment. I asked them why won't they ever punish my brother. My mother replied "Because I say so!" And I started yelling and crying, they yelled at me back, so I told them I was going to run away. And my step-father replied "Go ahead, you'll never do it. You're weak." And so I ran away from home."</p>

<p>They found my sister's first son as he was laying down on a piece of cardboard outside a grocery store. My sister's first son reflected on his feelings, he said "Nothing in the world mattered anymore. I just wanted to lay down and die." As punishment for running away from home, his parents grounded him for 6 weeks.</p>

<h1>Thanksgiving</h1>
<p>Few days before Thanksgiving 2020, my sister and her boyfriend went out and partied it up at Las Vegas, Nevada. When they returned, my sister's boyfriend was diagnosed with coronavirus. He was asymptomatic. He did not care that he had coronavirus, because on Thanksgiving Day my sister and her boyfriend traveled 70 miles to their distant relatives. Upon their return, my sister's first son said to me, I am paraphrasing for my readers, he said to me "My father's sister's boyfriend is named Henry. Henry is an adult latino man of approximately 34 years old. Henry was arguing with his step-child about a bicycle. The step-child slammed a door in retaliation of Henry. The slamming door noise incited a larger argument among the other adults. Everyone was arguing. Then, Henry grabbed his girlfriend's car keys, and angrily drove away with her car (Henry stole his girlfriend's car). They called the police to report the stolen vehicle. When the police arrived, everyone told the police their stories about Henry. Their combined stories was that Henry molested all three of his step-children, and regularly choked two of his step-sons. Henry's step-daughter said her bathroom door handle had remained broken since the longest time, so while she showered, Henry walked in and said "Let me teach you how to bathe herself," and that was how Henry molested her. When the police left, Henry's girlfriend yelled at everyone and told us all to leave. Henry's girlfriend knew about everything, the abuse and molestation, she knew about all of it. She simply did not care. She loved Henry. She did not want Henry to leave."</p> 

<p>So then I replied to my sister's first son "Did Henry do anything to you?" And my sister's first son said to me "Recently, my mother took me to swim in a river. Henry was there. I was splashing water on him. And Henry told me "Do that one more time, and watch what will happen next. I'm warning you to stop spashing water on me." I did not listen to Henry's warning. I splashed him again. Immediately, Henry submerged himself underneath the water. A few seconds I didn't see him. Suddenly, I felt something pull my shorts and underwear down, and it was Henry, and he touched my private parts." Then, my mother interrupted my sister's first son by saying to him "No. That's not what you told me." I yelled at my mother "Shut up, you're always in denial. He said what he said." So basically, he once told his parents "Henry pulled my pants and underwear down..." They interrogated my sister's first son, as if my sister's first son was about to be punished if he responds incorrectly, if you don't already know my sister's first son gets beat up for nearly anything, so my sister's first son changed his story and said "Henry pulled my pants down... but it was a funny prank he played on me." So then I asked him "If you knew that Henry was bad, why were you excited to visit his house on Thanksgiving." He replied "I'm very extroverted, I just wanted to laugh and play games with the other children." Finally, my sister's first son said "My mother said I am not allowed to speak about what happened to me, because no one here is qualified to give advice. I was supposed to keep this a secret. But I had to tell someone."</p>

<p>My sister and her boyfriend reported Henry and his girlfriend to social services. Then my sister installed a security camera system because she is paranoid that Henry might seek revenge.  My aunt told me "Henry's girlfriend has a history of abusive relationships. All three of her children are from different fathers. And she has protected all of her abusive boyfriends. At one point, she lived in a public housing for domestic violence survivors. She lived there with her boyfriend who was actively abusing her. Also, her mother died recently while jay walking at night, and now they are trying to sue the hospital for malpractice."</p>

<h1>Psychiatric Hospital</h1>
<p>During December 2020, my relatives told me "Your sister's first son was banging his head on the wall, an ambulance was called. Now he is temporarily living in a psychiatric ward for children."</p>

<p>During a phone conversation, my sister's first son said to his brother "Hi brother, I am not going to be home for a couple days. I am in therapy. I will be better soon. They are going to fix me. I am not going to be mean to you anymore. I love you brother." I believe it was about one week he lived in the psychiatric ward. When he returned home he said to me "It was a prison for children. In the hospital, I got very angry and I started banging my head on the table." I replied "Why were you doing that?" He replied "Because they failed understand me. That is a non issue compared to what happens next. A kid who was a patient there, he pulled my pants down and he touched my private parts. I reported him to the employees, but the employees refused to believe me. Immediately, another kid went forward which corroborated our victimizations. He confessed that same kid touched his private parts too. Suddenly, the kid who touched us became angry, all three of us were angry, we were running around like lunatics, at one point I punched a wall. So then a doctor chased after us, the doctor pulled my pants down and injected my butt with a needle containing a drug. Suddenly, I heard a ringing noise in my hear, I was hallucinating. My life turned into a video game simulation. I failed to sleep because of that ringing noise in my ear. I am still feeling the effects of the drug right now. My parents barely picked me up from there." The ringing noise he heard was probably his tinnitus, he diagnosed as hearing impaired, and vision impaired. I felt sorry asking him this, but I had to better understand this hospital, how does one explain racism to a kid? I asked him "The kid who touched your private parts, how did he look? What color was his skin?" He replied "He was obviously a mexican like me."</p>

<p>His eyes were all woozy, he was clearly on a drug. His great-aunt said "We took him to a sporting supply store. He warned us about a guy who was purchasing a gun, he warned us this guy might follow us home, and he warned us this guy might kill us. He was paranoid." When he returned from the sporting supply store, he said "I never told anyone about this, but ever since I was a kid I battled with depression. My depression is why I lost interest in art and dancing. I don't want to live anymore." Another thing I noticed when he returned from the hospital, all of a sudden he was speaking a new ghetto language he was saying things like "My shoes are tight yo, I'mma be so fresh in these laces."</p>

<h1>Manic Episode</h1>
<p>The doctors recommended a medication called Lithium. My sister and her boyfriend are against medications on children, so they purchased CBD gummy bears instead of Lithium. When their first son was released from the hospital, my sister immediately gave their first son two CBD gummy bears. 24 hours later, their first son was screaming because his stomach was hurting. He was frequently urinating. It seemed he was having a drug induced manic episode. He screamed out loud "Please, I don't want to go back. It was traumatic when the doctor injected my butt, he was a stranger looking at my naked butt. My stomach hurts. This is torture." He was screaming and crying for about one hour. My aunt found the bag of CBD gummy bears and confronted my sister and my sister's boyfriend by saying "Are you giving marijuana to your son?" My sister's boyfriend replied "You're f**king stupid. It's not marijuana. It's called CBD. It's perfectly safe, legal, and natural. It has no effects on your mind. Shut up. Don't speak on things you are ignorant about." So then I googled CBD and learned it has drug interactions, specifically CBD slows the metabolism of most medications. I never told them what I read about CBD. My sister said "What was the last thing you ate?" Suddenly, their first son said "It wasn't the cereal I ate. Mommy, I started feeling like this ever since you gave me those gummy bears." His step-father commented "His stomach doesn't hurt. He is merely a spoiled brat." My sister said the doctor injected him, she said "I believe it was Thorazine with the letter D, something like that."</p>


<h1>Tattoos</h1>
<p>When my sister's first son was 6 years old, he drew a mustache and unibrow on himself with washable crayola markers. He said "Haha mommy look at my funny mustache and unibrow." So then my sister beat him up because it reminded her of the face tattoos his biological father had. And the worst part is my sister has tattoos on her own body. She has an enormous lower back tattoo, and I was told that she may have other tattoos. My sister's current boyfriend, I have seen the tattoos spanning his chest and upper shoulders. Basically my sister is harsh and aggressive against her first son to prevent him from being a gangmember like his imprisoned latino father. That is why my sister always punishes her first son, and never punishes her second son. Also, because her second son is blood related to her current boyfriend. For example, when my sister's first son was 7 years old, she enrolled her first son into piano lessons. He threw a tantrum because he did not want to be in piano lessons. So my sister beat him up. I was told that my sister "went all out" and beat him up "as if he were another adult."</p>

<h1>The Bubble Boy</h1>
<p>When my sister's first son was 8 years old, during Christmas season, my sister went on a vacation to a snowy cabin. My sister invited other people. I was told that my sister in the snowy cabin she announced to all the children "Okay children, it's time for bedtime. Please put away your electronics. Good night." Momentarily later, my sister's first son snuck out of his bedroom and he told his great-aunt "My mother said to put away our electronics. The other kids pretended to put away their electronics, they pretended to fall asleep; but when my mother left, those kids resumed to their electronics. They are not following my mother's advice. And the other kids called me bad names, they told me I should play videogames like the rest of them." So then his great-aunt told him "Remember the bible principles we talked about, the bible teaches us that one bad apple spoils the bunch. The best you can do is distance yourself from bad people. Go back in there, ignore the other kids, and you go to sleep. When you are having more doubts, you should always consult a trustworthy adult, adults have more life experience than you." Then, I am not certain how this happened next but somehow my sister yelled at his great-aunt "What the f**k are you doing? Stop teaching my son about God. So it's all your fault why my son is having behavioral issues. Because you are teaching my son that life is a fairy tale, but that's not how the real world works. I am raising my son to be a man, he must make his own mistakes and learn from them. If you keep treating him like a baby, he'll never leave. He has to move out one day and make his own decisions. Everyone experiences peer pressure and bullying, it's a part of growing up, it builds character. You're teaching my son bad ideas like how to be a snitch, no one wants be friends with a snitch, he will be outcasted, he will be antisocial, he won't have any friends, he will be depressed and suicidal, he'll never leave the house, he'll always be the Bubble Boy afraid of the world. It's all your fault. Everything is your fault. Get the f**k outta my face, stay away from my family."</p>

<h1>Stealing Christmas</h1>
<p>Then, on Christmas day, my sister's first son received a gift card from someone. About a month after christmas day, my sister's first son told me "My mother told me to think carefully about what I want to purchase with my gift card. Then, my mother confiscated my gift card from me. She said when I know what I want to purchase, I should tell her so that she may return my gift card back to me. I waited for this one specific video game to be released soon. When the video game was finally realeased, I told my mother, "Mommy I know what I want to purchase with my gift card, a new videogame!" Then my mother replied "You don't have a gift card anymore. I spent your gift card on myself. Mommy has to take care of herself before she can take care of others. Stop crying, or else you're grounded and I'm gonna spank you. It's your fault because you waited too long. Your brother knew exactly what he wanted, that is why he spent his gift card. Be more like your brother. This is your lessson to stop overthinking everything, the world has no tolerance for slow pokes like you." And what did my sister purchase with the christmas money she stole, she purchased clothes for herself, even though she already has mountains of adidas and nike clothes and shoes.</p>

<h1>Alcoholism</h1>
<p>The first time I ever met my sister's boyfriend, my intuition told me he was an alcoholic. I straight up asked him "Are you an alcoholic?" My sister's boyfriend replied "I'm not addicted to alcohol. We only see each other during the holidays when it is normal to drink alcohol. I only drink alcohol during holidays and parties." This was the first time I ever met him so I told myself "He's definitely addicted to alcohol. He doesn't realize this is the first time I ever met him. He thinks I've seen him before." A few weeks later, my sister asked me to install Ikea furniture at her home, 2 bunk beds and 2 computer desks. This was the first time I ever visited my sister's home, and low and behold, my sister and her boyfriend were drinking alcohol. I told my sister's boyfriend "I thought you're not addicted to alcohol." He replied "I only drink during weekends." I was there for about 4 days in a row installing one Ikea furniture per day. Every single day I was there my sister and her boyfriend were drinking alcohol. They just sat around drinking alcohol, and my sister said "What the f**k. Why are they charging me for Amazon, HBO, and Hulu. You told me it was a free trial." My sister's boyfriend replied "You're the one who uses those services the most. I forgot to cancel the free trial. It's not a big deal." Then, they just had random people in their home. One person was a fat woman, they were each sitting on a table drinking beer, and the fat woman said "Jocelyne's boyfriend is an unemployed alcoholic. Jocelyne drunkenly confessed that she only stays with him because he eats her p***y good. She stuck out her tongue to simulate cunnilingus. It was such an embarrassment for Jocelyne because her brother was there. Lorena is still single. Maria has a crazy stalker. And Daniela's boyfriend just got out of prison." All day long that fat woman was gossiping, her butt was glued to that chair, she rarely moved her body, only her mouth was moving nonstop like the Energizer rabbit. Finally, I assembeled one Ikea desk, I exited the bedroom and the fat woman said "Who is that?" My sister replied "That's my younger brother, Jovanny." Then out of nowhere the fat woman still glued to her chair said "Oh Jovanny, yeah he was friends with Miguel and Jonathan in High School..." I had never seen this woman ever in my life, and somehow she had all my information. So then, one day my sister drove through a fire hydrant which exploded. My sister said "I wasn't drunk. I was a little hungover. Anyways, I am quitting alcohol. Alcohol is played out. It's not enjoyable anymore. I quit." The following months my sister continued drinking alcohol, until finally a doctor told her she had to stop drinking alcohol because something was wrong with my her liver. My sister didn't follow her doctor's advice because she continued drinking. My sister already had her appendix removed, and gallblader removed. And that was how my aunt asked my sister's boyfriend "Have you considered what you would do if your girlfriend died?"</p>

<h1>Dramatic</h1>
<p>My aunt asked my sister's boyfriend "Have you considered what you would do if your girlfriend died?" My sister's boyfriend replied "I would take my own son with me, and I will abandon my step-son here with you people. I don't trust you people to take care of my own son. Your family gives preferential to my step-son, so I know he'll be safe here." One day, my sister texted my mother "Mother, can you please take care of my children for me?" My mother replied "I'm very busy and tired. I had a long day of work. The best thing I can do is I can only take care of your first son, because your second son is too young so he cries too much." Then my sister went on a rampage during a group chat to our entire family, she said "I hate my family because you people give preferential to my first son. That's it, I don't need anyone anymore. F**k all of you people. Don't ever talk to me. I'm not celebrating the holidays with my family anymore. I'm deleting all your phone numbers, and blocking all of you." Then, the next day my sister acted normal like nothing happened.</p>

<h1>Intoxicated Driving</h1>
<p>So then my sister's first son told me "My step-father drank alcohol and commanded me to go in the car. I told him it's not safe to drink and drive. My step-father replied "Don't be a scaredy cat. It was only one drink. Get in the car. It's just around the corner." My step-father drunkenly swerved his car around the streets. When we finally reached our home, my step-father suddenly got very angry at me and he started choking me. I didn't do anything to deserve this punishment. Moments later, my step-father told me "I am sorry, I am mean to you sometimes. Daddy had a long day of work. I love you. Good night." My sister also drives under the influence with her children in the backseats. My aunt confronted my sister about this, and my sister replied "I don't care, shut the f**k up." Literally, everyone in my family is aware that my sister does these horrible things.</p>

<h1>Violent Party</h1>
<p>All throughout the coronavirus pandemic, my sister went to parties. Here's what my sister's first son told me, he was 9 years old and this is what he told me, I am paraphrasing so it makes more sense to my readers, he said "During the pandemic, my sister took me to many different parties. In one specific party, my step-father's friend was choking another man. One man kicked chairs and tables and started yelling at his girlfriend. The man yelling at his girlfriend was the most concerning thing to me. The situation got so bad. I thought someone was going to pull out a gun and start killing people. So I grabbed all the children and I pushed them to go inside a dog house. I stood in front of the dog house door to protect the children. I believed I was about to die. I imagined the bullet killing me. My mother grabbed me, and my brother, and together we all ran to our car." So apparently this party was so bad that even my sister was afraid she was going to die.</p>



<h1>Skateboard</h1>
<p>Ever since my sister's first son returned from that hospital, his personality had changed. He is demented now. You could argue it was from all the years of living in a bad home. I don't think it's that. I honestly believe it all started when his parents purchased a skateboard for him, but they did not purchase a helmet. He is the wimpiest kid, but I guess he wanted a skateboard because he wants to be manly. His step-father is always teaching him how to be a man. It's so annoying. His step-father taught his children how to play fight. Then, his children play fight until someone gets hurt for real. It's like I said in my blog, male children are taught how to play fight, and then they grow up and get in real fights. It gets worse. One day my sister's first son accidentally cut his leg, when he witnessed his own blood he fainted. Multiple times he has seen blood and fainted. So then one day my sister's first son told me "My step-father forces me to watch gore movies so I can stop being weak. He says I faint because I am the bubble boy." It's so messed up. When my sister's first son was 7 years old, he wanted light up sketcher shoes. My sister told him "Ew! Those shoes are ugly! You should buy these other shoes." He replied "I really like these sketcher shoes." My sister told him "You look ugly." My aunt was there and said "Don't buy him those red nike shoes. That color is associated with a gang called bloods." My sister replied "Shut the f**k up. The real gangs are the police." Ever since then, my sister's first son has been obsessed about what clothes he wears, he is obsessed with trying to be cool.</p>

<h1>Racism</h1>
<p>My sister's boyfriend has relatives who are african-american. One african-american child literally beats up my sister's first son. My sister's first son told me "My cousin dragged me against the concrete floor and that was how I got this scab. I told my mother, and she said it was my fault because I was being too bossy, no one wants to be friends with bossy people. My cousin constantly punches me, he says bad words, and bullies me. My great-aunt taught me how to use my vocabulary to express my feelings. So I asked my cousin to please be nicer to me, and I asked him to stop saying bad words. Then my mother yelled at me and said that I was being racist, she commanded me to stop talking to my great-aunt who is teaching me bad ideas." And then my cousin said "He is constantly being punched by his african-american cousin. I think it's great they are teaching him about god and religion. But it's doing him harm. He allows others to bully him. He needs to stand up for himself. I commanded him to punch his cousin back. He said that Jesus teaches us that we should turn the other cheek. He really is the bubble boy. He is going to have problems in the future when he realizes there are more mean people in this world. He needs to stop talking to his great-aunt who is teaching him bad ideas."</p>
