<p>My sister is the #1 reason why I am disgusted by the Black Lives Matter movement. So here goes her story. It's not just my sister, it's her boyfriend, it's all their friends. All of them openly say things like "I hate all white people." My sister worships the black lives matter movement. Ever since she was a teenager, she has been saying "F**k the police, I hate pigs." Ever since my sister went to college, she has been spewing out all these racist historical facts. Unfortunately, I did not live with my sister, I am mostly oblivious to my sister's barbaric parenting methods. Over the years, I was able to hear about these stories. I am sorry if all of these stories are confusing to understand.</p>

<h1>Running Away</h1>
<p>My sister's first son had gradually developed anger issues over the years. Even before Henry had molested him, he was seeing a therapist for anger management, and his parents purchased anger management books for him to read. When he was 9 years old, he finally asked his parents "Is he my real dad?" And his parents finally told the partial truth. Suddenly, he realized that his parents had lied to him about his origins, and he wondered what other lies they told him. A few weeks later, he was in a verbal argument with his parents, which he told me about it, he said {paraphrase} "My parents always punish me, but they never punish my brother. My brother does whatever he wants and my parents allow it. My parents told me I was grounded, not allowed to play videogames anymore, so I argued against their unfair punishments. I asked them why don't they ever punish my brother. My mother replied "Don't question my authority! Because I say so!" And I started yelling and crying, they yelled at me back, so I told them I was going to run away. And my step-father replied "Go ahead, you'll never do it. You're weak." And so I ran away from home."</p>

<p>So then, they found my sister's first son as he was laying down on a piece of cardboard outside a grocery store. My sister's first son reflected on his feelings, he said "Nothing in the world mattered anymore. I just wanted to lay down and die." His parents grounded him for 6 weeks because he ran away from home. His step-father said "He is a spoiled brat. He needs to be disciplined. He needs to have manners, and to learn life's principles. When this pandemic is over, I am signing him up for karate classes."</p>


<h1>Tattoos</h1>
<p>When my sister's first son was 6 years old, he drew a mustache and unibrow on himself with washable crayola markers. He said "Haha mommy look at my funny mustache and unibrow." So then my sister beat him up because it reminded her of the face tattoos his biological father had. And the worst part is my sister has tattoos on her own body. She has an enormous lower back tattoo, and I was told that she may have other tattoos. My sister's current boyfriend, I have seen the tattoos spanning his chest and upper shoulders. Basically my sister is harsh and aggressive against her first son because she wants to prevent him from being a gangmember like his imprisoned latino father. That is why my sister always punishes her first son, and never punishes her second son. Because her second son is blood related to her current boyfriend. For example, when my sister's first son was 7 years old, she enrolled her first son into piano lessons. He threw a tantrum because he did not want to be in piano lessons. So my sister beat him up. I was told that my sister "went all out" and beat him up "as if he were another adult."</p>

<h1>The Bubble Boy</h1>
<p>When my sister's first son was 8 years old, during Christmas season, my sister went on a vacation to a snowy cabin. My sister invited other people. I was told that my sister in the snowy cabin she announced to all the children "Okay children, it's time for bedtime. Please put away your electronics. Good night." Momentarily later, my sister's first son snuck out of his bedroom and he told his great-aunt "My mother said to put away our electronics. The other kids pretended to put away their electronics, they pretended to fall asleep; but when my mother left, those kids resumed to their electronics. They are not following my mother's advice. And the other kids called me bad names, they told me I should play videogames like the rest of them." So then his great-aunt told him "Remember the bible principles we talked about, the bible teaches us that one bad apple spoils the bunch. The best you can do is distance yourself from bad people. Go back in there, ignore the other kids, and you go to sleep. When you are having more doubts, you should always consult a trustworthy adult, adults have more life experience than you." Then, I am not certain how this happened next but somehow my sister yelled at his great-aunt "What the f**k are you doing? Stop teaching my son about God. So it's all your fault why my son is having behavioral issues. Because you are teaching my son that life is a fairy tale, but that's not how the real world works. I am raising my son to be a man, he must make his own mistakes and learn from them. If you keep treating him like a baby, he'll never leave. He has to move out one day and make his own decisions. Everyone experiences peer pressure and bullying, it's a part of growing up, it builds character. You're teaching my son bad ideas like how to be a snitch, no one wants be friends with a snitch, he will be outcasted, he will be antisocial, he won't have any friends, he will be depressed and suicidal, he'll never leave the house, he'll always be the Bubble Boy afraid of the world. It's all your fault. Everything is your fault. Get the f**k outta my face, stay away from my family."</p>

<h1>Stealing Christmas</h1>
<p>Then, on Christmas day, my sister's first son received a gift card from someone. About a month after christmas day, my sister's first son told me "My sister took my gift card, she told me to think careful about what I want to purchase with my gift card. She said when I know what I want to buy, that I should tell her so that she may give my gift card back. I was waiting for this one specific video game to be released soon. When the video game was finally realeased, I told my mommy, "Mommy I know what I want to purchase with my gift card, a videogame!" Then my mother replied "You don't have a gift card anymore. I spent your gift card money on myself. It's your fault because you waited too long. You have to learn a lesson to stop being a slow thinker. The world is not going to wait for you to make a decision. Your brother knew exactly what he wanted, that is why he got to spend his gift card money, unlike you. You are too slow. Stop crying, or else you're grounded and I'm gonna spank you." Basically, here it was apparent that my sister and her boyfriend give preferential treatment to their second son, because my sister's boyfriend is blood related to him.</p>

<h1>Alcoholism</h1>
<p>The first time I ever met my sister's boyfriend, my intuition told me he was an alcoholic. I straight up asked him "Are you an alcoholic?" My sister's boyfriend replied "I'm not addicted to alcohol. We only see each other during the holidays when it is normal to drink alcohol. I only drink alcohol during holidays and parties." This was the first time I ever met him so I told myself "He's definitely addicted to alcohol. He doesn't realize this is the first time I ever met him. He thinks I've seen him before." A few weeks later, my sister asked me to install Ikea furniture at her home, 2 bunk beds and 2 computer desks. This was the first time I ever visited my sister's home, and low and behold, my sister and her boyfriend were drinking alcohol. I told my sister's boyfriend "I thought you're not addicted to alcohol." He replied "I only drink during weekends." I was there for about 4 days in a row installing one Ikea furniture per day. Every single day I was there my sister and her boyfriend were drinking alcohol. They just sat around drinking alcohol, and my sister said "What the f**k. Why are they charging me for Amazon, HBO, and Hulu. You told me it was a free trial." My sister's boyfriend replied "You're the one who uses those services the most. I forgot to cancel the free trial. It's not a big deal." Then, they just had random people in their home. One person was a fat woman, they were each sitting on a table drinking beer, and the fat woman said "Jocelyne's boyfriend is an unemployed alcoholic. One day, Jocelyne was drunk when she confessed that she only stays with him because he eats her p***y good. She stuck out her tongue to demonstrate how he does it. It was such an embarrassment for Jocelyne because her brother was there. And Lorena is still single. And Maria has a crazy stalker. And Daniela's boyfriend just got out of prison." All day long that fat woman was gossping, her butt was glued to that chair, she rarely moved her body, only her mouth was moving nonstop like the Energizer rabbit. Finally, I assembeled one Ikea desk, I exited the bedroom and the fat woman said "Who is that?" My sister said "That's my younger brother, Jovanny." Then out of nowhere the fat woman still glued to her chair said "Oh Jovanny, yeah he was friends with Miguel and Jonathan in High School..." I had never seen this woman ever in my life, and somehow she had all my information. So then, one day my sister drove through a fire hydrant which exploded. My sister said "I wasn't drunk. I was a little hungover. Anyways, I am quitting alcohol. Alcohol is played out. It's not enjoyable anymore. I quit." The following months my sister continued drinking alcohol, until finally a doctor told her she had to stop drinking alcohol because something was wrong with my her liver. My sister didn't follow her doctor's advice because she continued drinking. My sister already had her appendix removed, and gallblader removed. And that was how my aunt asked my sister's boyfriend "Have you considered what you would do if your girlfriend died?"</p>

<h1>Dramatic</h1>
<p>My aunt asked my sister's boyfriend "Have you considered what you would do if your girlfriend died?" My sister's boyfriend replied "I would take my own son with me, and I will abandon my step-son here with you people. I don't trust you people to take care of my own son. Your family gives preferential to my step-son, so I know he'll be safe here." One day, my sister texted my mother "Mother, can you please take care of my children for me?" My mother replied "I'm very busy and tired. I had a long day of work. The best thing I can do is I can only take care of your first son, because your second son is too young so he cries too much." Then my sister went on a rampage during a group chat to our entire family, she said "I hate my family because you people give preferential to my first son. That's it, I don't need anyone anymore. F**k all of you people. Don't ever talk to me. I'm not celebrating the holidays with my family anymore. I'm deleting everyone's phone numbers, and blocking all of you." Then, the next day my sister acted normal like nothing happened.</p>



<h1>Violent Party</h1>
<p>All throughout the coronavirus pandemic, my sister went to parties. Here's what my sister's first son told me, he was 9 years old and this is what he told me, I am paraphrasing so it makes more sense to my readers, he said "During the pandemic, my sister took me to many different parties. In one specific party, my step-father's friend was choking another man. One man kicked chairs and tables and started yelling at his girlfriend. The man yelling at his girlfriend was the most concerning thing to me. The situation got so bad. I thought someone was going to pull out a gun and start killing people. So I grabbed all the children and I pushed them to go inside a dog house. I stood in front of the dog house door to protect the children. I believed I was about to die. I imagined the bullet killing me. My mother grabbed me, and my brother, and together we all ran to our car." So apparently this party was so bad that even my sister was afraid she was going to die.</p>

<h1>Thanksgiving</h1>
<p>Few days before Thanksgiving 2020, my sister and her boyfriend went out and partied it up at Las Vegas, Nevada. When they returned, my sister's boyfriend was diagnosed with coronavirus. He was asymptomatic. He did not care that he had coronavirus, because on Thanksgiving Day my sister and her boyfriend visited their distant relatives. When they returned, my sister's first son said to me, I am paraphrasing for my readers, he said to me "My father's sister's boyfriend is named Henry. Henry is an adult latino man. Henry was arguing with his step-child about a bicycle. The step-child slammed a door in retaliation of Henry. The door slamming invited a larger argument among the other adults. Everyone was arguing. Then, Henry grabbed his girlfriend's car keys, and angrily drove away with her car (Henry stole his girlfriend's car). They called the police to report the stolen vehicle. When the police arrived, everyone told the police their stories about Henry. Two of Henry's step-children told the police that Henry had an extensive history of choking them. All three of Henry's step-children told the police that Henry had an extensive history of sexual molestation. One of Henry's step-children, said that her bathroom door handle had remained broken since the longest time, so while she was taking a shower, Henry walked in and said to her "Let me teach you how to bathe herself," and that was how Henry molested her. When the police left, Henry's girlfriend yelled at everyone and told us all to leave. Henry's girlfriend was angry because she had protected Henry, and now she might go to prison as an accomplice. She knew about everything, the abuse and molestation, she knew about all of it. She simply did not care. She loved Henry. She did not want him to leave." 

<p>So then I replied to my sister's first son "Did Henry do anything to you?" And my sister's first son said to me "Recently, my mother took me to swim in a river. Henry was there. I was splashing water on him. And Henry told me "Do that one more time, and watch what will happen next. I'm warning you to stop spashing water on me." And I did not listen to Henry's warning. I splashed him again. And immediately Henry submerged himself underneath the water. For a few seconds I didn't see him. Then, suddenly I felt something pull my shorts and underwear down, and it was Henry, and he started touching my private parts." Then, my mother interrupted my sister's first son by saying to him "No. That's not what you told me." I yelled at my mother "Shut the f**k up, you're always in denial. He said what he said." So basically, my sister's first son had told his parents "Henry pulled my pants and underwear down..." Then they interrogated my sister's first son, as if my sister's first son was about to be punished if he responds incorrectly, if you don't already know my sister's first son gets beat up for nearly anything, so my sister's first son changed his story and said "Henry pulled my pants down... but it was a funny prank he played on me." So then I asked him "If you knew that Henry was bad, why were you excited to visit his house on Thanksgiving." He replied "I'm very extroverted, I just wanted to laugh and play games with the other children."</p>

<p>Finally, my sister's first son said "My mother said I am not allowed to speak about what happened to me, because no one here is qualified to give me advice. I was supposed to keep this a secret. But I had to tell someone."</p>

<p>So then my sister installed a houshold security camera system because she is paranoid that Henry is going to seek revenge. My sister and her boyfriend reported Henry and his girlfriend to social services. And then my aunt told me "Henry's girlfriend has a history of abusive relationships. All three of her children are from different fathers. And she has protected all of her abusive boyfriends. At one point, she lived in a public housing for domestic violence survivors. She lived there with her boyfriend who was actively abusing her. She went against the welfare terms, by using her public housing to house her abuser. Recently, her mother died while jay walking at night, and now they are trying to sue the hospital for malpractice."</p>

<p>And this story does not end here. There's so much more. But I will continue later.</p>

<h1>Psychiatric Hospital</h1>
<p>Few months after my sister's first son ran away from home, over the phone my sister told my mother "I cancelled all my plans for today. I am at the police station right now. I'm teaching my first son where he'll end up if he keeps acting like this." My mother said "What are you doing to him?!" My sister replied "Nothing. I just beat him up a little that is all. I gotta go, bye." Then, my mother told me "I heard him crying in the background." He is still 9 years old at this point. Several weeks later, I received the news that my sister's first son was gone. They told me that my sister and her first son were arguing, and then the only thing my relatives told me is "Your sister's first son was hurting himself, so they called the police and ambulance on him. Your sister asked the public school for recommendations. And that was how your sister immediately sent her first son to a psychiatric ward for children." I had so many questions. I asked them "What do you mean he was hurting himself?" They replied "We don't know."</p>

<p>My sister's first son said to his brother over the phone "Hi brother, I am not going to be home for a couple days. I am in therapy right now. I am going to be better soon. They are going to fix me. I am not going to be mean to you anymore. I love you brother." I believe it was about one week he lived in the psychiatric ward. When he returned home he said to me "Hi, right now I barely returned from the psychiatric ward, also known as a prison for children. I was banging my head on the wall, that is why they sent there. While I was at the hospital, I got very angry and I started banging my head on the table." I replied "Why were you doing that?" He replied "I don't know. Don't you feel angry sometimes and feel like banging your head on the wall?" I replied "No." He replied "When I am angry I lose control of myself."</p>

<p>Then, he continued "So then a kid pulled my pants down and he touched my private parts, he was another patient there. I reported him to the employees, but they refused to believe my story. They said I was lying. So I got angry and I started crying. Then, another kid went forward and corroborated my story. He confessed that same kid touched his private parts too. Then, the kid who touched us, he got angry and now all three of us were angry, we were running around like lunatics, at one point I punched a wall. So then a doctor chased after us one by one, he got to me first, the doctor pulled my pants and injected my butt with a needle. He gave me one shot. He one of the other kids two shots. It was a drug. I heard a ringing noise in my hear, and then I started hallucinating. I started seeing pixels everywhere, I was living in a simulation. I tried to sleep, but I couldn't sleep because I kept hearing the loud noise in my ear. My parents picked me up, and I am here now. I am still feeling the effects of the drugs right now." I felt really sorry asking him this, but I had to ask so I could better understand this hospital, I mean how do I explain racism to a kid? Finally, I asked him "The kid who touched your private parts, how did he look? What color was his skin?" He replied "He was obviously a mexican like me. He had the same skin color as me."</p>

<p>The ringing noise he hears was his tinnitus, a long time ago a doctor diagnosed him with being imparied from one ear, and impaired from one eye. His eyes were all woozy, he was clearly on a drug. Then, he went to a store, and my aunt said "We took him to a sporting supply store. He kept telling me that he saw a guy purchasing a gun, and that he believed we were being followed by him, and that he might try to kill us. He was paranoid." When he returned from the sporting supply store, he said "My imagination is improved. Everything seems so vivid and realistic. I never told anyone about this, but every since I was a kid I have been battling with depression. My depression was the reason why I lost interest in art and dancing. And sometimes I feel like killing myself. I want to die. I don't wanna be alive anymore. I don't ever want to go back to that hospital ever again. It was traumatic when the doctor injected my butt, he was a stranger looking at my naked butt. Please, I don't want to go back." He was 9 years old and high on drugs telling me all this. Another thing I noticed when he returned from the hospital, all of a sudden he was speaking a new ghetto language he was saying things like "My shoes are tight yo, bruh I'mma be so fresh in these laces bro."</p>
