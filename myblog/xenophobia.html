<h1>Xenophobia</h1>
<p>If Ethan does not understand something, he instinctively fears it, he hates it, and wants to destroy it. For example, Ethan does not understand Ellen Degeneres, therefore Ethan hates Ellen. He called Ellen an "elf," another word for "fairy", a derogatory term against homosexuals.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\ellen.webm"></audio></span><br>Ethan does not understand gayness, that is why he hates it. The thing Ethan hates the most are pedophiles. That is why whenever Ethan hates someone, he always calls them a pedophile. In Ethan's mind, gay, hate, and pedophilia are all synonyms.</p>

<h1>Homophobia</h1>
<p class="two">Notice how Ethan says "I do not understand kpop" and then proceeds to hate it using slurs against homosexuals.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\kpop.webm"></audio></span><br>The same way Ethan believes grown men should not watch kpop, Ethan also believes grown men should not play minecraft. That explains why Ethan created this video portraying minecraft players as sexual deviants.<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21565&authkey=AFvyw_3gypnAcZE" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<h1>Sexual Harassment</h1>
<p class="two">Due to Ethan's Minecraft video, Ethan was suspended from Youtube on August 11, 2021 for 7 days because Ethan Klein broke Youtube's "bullying and sexual harassment" policy because Ethan simulated having sex with a red puppet. The red puppet is based on a real adult man named Daniel Keem. Whenever Ethan hates you, he makes a doll of you and has sex with it on camera to make you feel worthless and weak.<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21570&authkey=AFdT0w9qbf4Fxc0" type="video/mp4"></video><br>On July 4, 2020 Ethan saw this creepy Shane Dawson video. Four months later, suddenly Ethan Klein owns a Daniel Keem puppet. This creepy video literally inspired Ethan.</p>

<h1>Zach Choi</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan believes grown men should not do ASMR. When Ethan saw a man named Zack Choi doing ASMR, Ethan's first comment was "This guy is a freak. Is he straight? Or is he a gay pedophile?"<br><video controls preload="none"><source src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=71C45DE3883A02A0&resid=71C45DE3883A02A0%21589&authkey=AKLFfm7GxYP3qe0" type="video/mp4"></video><br>When Ethan said "Zack Choi has skeletons in the closet" it's because Ethan believes if you are a gay pedophile, most likely your father raped you when you were a child, that is how you turned gay, and the trauma makes you interested in ASMR as a coping mechanism. Ethan made it clear on twitter that he thinks it's okay for women to be lesbians; because he enjoys watching lesbian porn <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191008152651/https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1181587708658909184">1</a></span>, but he thinks its wrong for men to be homosexual.<br>Also, Ethan believes grown men should not watch japanese anime. Ethan believes watching japanese anime is a red flag that you are a gay pedophile.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\anime.webm"></audio></span>

<h1>Boogie2988</h1>
<p class="two">This is how Ethan reacts when a 43 year old man (boogie2988) is dating a 19 year old woman (Lucy Foxx).<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\boogie.webm"></audio></span></p>

<h1>James Charles</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan is so blatantly homophobic that even TikTok deletes Ethan's videos due to homophobia <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ethankleinh3/video/6945220924778040582">2</a></span>, because Ethan constantly calls James Charles (gay) a pedo <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNBcgcwj3nX/?utm_source=ig_embed">1</a>,</span><span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNBXhxGDt2y/?utm_source=ig_embed">2</a>.</span> So whenenver a straight man goes after young girls, Ethan congratulates him. But whenever a gay man goes after young boys, Ethan gets extremely angry.</p>

<h1>Sexism</h1>
<p class="two">Ethan Klein said "It's so sad how society does not take victims of sexual abuse seriously." Here is Ethan Klein not giving a f*ck about the male victim of sexual abuse Spencer Elden. Spencer Elden is the naked baby on the Nirvana album artwork. Spencer Elden filed a lawsuit claiming to be a male victim of child pornography. Ethan Klein described Spencer Elden's lawsuit as "obviously a cashgrab." Ethan Klein believes Spencer Elden is acting like a victim for financial gain.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\charles.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\charles2.webm"></audio></span><br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\nevermind.webm"></audio></span><br></p>

<h1>Homophobia - Ian Slater</h1>
<p class="two">Imagine this. You apply for a job. But in order to get hired, you have to prove you're not a homosexual. That's literally what Ethan did to Ian Slater. For a long time, Ian's sexual orientation was unknown. That explains why Ethan forced Ian to be on a dating show. For years, Ethan bullied Ian because Ian was too effeminate. Eventually, Ian got a girlfriend and the bullying stopped. Here is Ian Slater saying he was happy being single, but then he felt forced into getting a girlfriend like it was a job requirement.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\ian3.webm"></audio></span><br>On Episode #134 Ethan forced Ian to be on a dating show. On episode #149 Ian got a girlfriend. On episode #150, Ian became a full time employee. It was the weirdest "prove you're not gay" hiring process. On episode #193 Ian had a foot injury.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\ian6.webm"></audio></span><br>On episode #206 Ethan planned to use Ian's foot injury as an excuse to fire Ian. I truly believe Ethan tried to fire Ian because he thinks Ian is too effeminate. But then Human Resources got involved.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\ian5.webm"></audio></span><br>Here is Ethan calling Ian "stupid" and Ian felt so sad, he turned off his own microphone.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\ian7.webm"></audio></span><br>In one video, Ethan pranked Ian by telling him he is fired, and Ian almost cried on camera <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/-o0H2hp2lyY?t=315">1</a></span>. Ethan titled a second video "Ethan fires Ian <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdIpixFKcOI">2</a></span>." Ethan titled a third video "We Replaced Ian With A Robot <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB9KiJJlJL4">3</a></span>" The joke is that Ian is such a useless employee that his job can easily be replaced with a robot. Ethan constantly plays a recoring of Ian saying "I gotta pee so bad." The joke is that Ian is such a lazy employee, he hides in the bathroom to avoid doing work. Everyone thinks the "Ethan hates Ian" thing is a run on joke. Turns out it was not a joke. It was real workplace bullying. In a different video, Ethan wanted to test Ian's masculinity by putting fire on Ian's beard, and immediately Ethan joked about burning and killing Ian <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu1kYYjrh74">4</a></span>.</p>

<h1>More Evidence</h1>
<p class="two">Episode #178 is the episode everyone says is evidence of Ethan bullying Ian. Ethan and Hila are angry because they feel like Ian does "shticks." In other words, they think Ian is hiding something, like Ian is in the closet. When Hila says "We talk about everything," she is trying to say they've been honest with Ian, and so they expect the same honesty back from Ian.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\ian.webm"></audio></span><br>At this point, it seems like Ian is lying about having a girlfriend. Ian claims to have a girlfriend, but whenever Ethan wants to meet Ian's girlfriend, Ian comes up with excuses of why noone can meet her. Here is Ethan demanding to meet Ian's girlfriend. Ethan said "There's more information than that," because Ethan thinks Ian is hiding something, like Ian is in the closet.<br><span align="center"><audio controls preload="none"><source src="xenophobia%20opus\bully.webm"></audio></span></p>
