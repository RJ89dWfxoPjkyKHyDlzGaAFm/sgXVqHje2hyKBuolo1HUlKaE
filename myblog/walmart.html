<h1>All of my relatives who support the Black Lives Matter hate Walmart. My BLM relatives won't shop at Walmart, they only shop at Target. And they don't shop at any Target, they only shop at the Target in White neighborhoods. My Uncle's BLM friend said "Target sells higher quality clothing styles than Walmart. The Target in our neighborhood, the aisles are very disorganized." My BLM sister and her BLM boyfriend said "I don't shop for clothing at Walmart or Target. I only purchase clothing from Nike or Adidas. We save money because Nike and Adidas clothing is higher quality which means it lasts longer." Meanwhile, my BLM sister and her BLM boyfriend purchase counterfeit Gucci bags from Chinatown. My BLM classmate said "If I had more money, I wouldn't choose Nike or Adidas. Nike and Adidas are for wretched people. I prefer Gucci or Louis Vuitton." </p>

<p>My BLM uncle said "Do you want to know why I hate Walmart? Go on Google Images and search for "People of Walmart Memes." Then, you will understand why I hate Walmart. Walmart customer service is the worst, because Walmart does not pay their employees a liveable wage." My BLM uncle is obsessed with customer service, every week he visits a different fancy restaurant because he loves to feel like a king when the waiter is grating his parmesean cheese. My BLM Uncle won't visit the same fancy restaurant twice in one month, he says "Oh no. I'm tired of that restaurant. I want to try something new today." My BLM uncle is so oppressed because he is a connoisseur of fine arts, his bedroom is decorated with a Tron movie poster, vinyl records from Amoeba, and Edgar Allan Poe themed paintings, he owns a jar marijuana, mountains of Adidas, and Nike clothing, he collects concert tickets. My BLM Uncle washes his luxurious delicate bedding material at a Laundromat. My BLM won't visit any Laundromat, he says "Oh no. That laundromat is filled with wretched people. I go to this other Laundromat." The Laundromat he chooses happens to reside in a white neighborhood. My relatives use that phrase "wretched" a lot. I used context clues to learn what that phrase means. I learned "wretched people" is a cryptic phrase that describes low income black people, low income latinos, low income white peoople, drug addicts, the mentally ill, the homeless, or beggars. Wretched simply means ghetto. And every BLM soldier in my family hates ghetto people. Whenever a BLM soldier in my family uses that phrase "wretched people" it means they are about to drive very fay away from the our ghetto neighborhood to arrive at a white neighborhood to purchase something simple like Mc Donalds, Cinnabon, Krispy Kreme, In N Out, Habitat, or Starbucks.</p>

<p>My very obese BLM cousin with body tattoos and peircings said "Buckle up, we're going to a far away Starbucks." I asked "Why?" My BLM cousin replied "Because the one in our neighborhood, the employees are wretched, the service is slow, they always get my order wrong, I asked for a cold scone, they gave me a warm one, it ruins the flavor. I don't want to stand next to stinky ass thong sandal wearing wretched Walmart people, I don't want to see crackheads doing drugs in our public restroom." My BLM cousin said "How is race a political debate? Everyone deserves equal treatment, it's common sense. Ugh! I hate Donald Trump. I hate White people. White people are inherently evil. If White people ceased to exist, humanity will become a utopia." And I know why my BLM cousin hates white people. When my BLM cousin was a kid, a latino man molested her. Then, when my BLM cousin was a young adult, she encoutered a charming latino man who sent her flowers and romantic text messages. My BLM cousin and this latino man became romantically involved together. Then, one day my BLM cousin gave birth to twins. Immediately, that latino man dissapeared. Overnight, my BLM cousin became a single mother of two children. And somehow all of this is White people's fault.</p>
