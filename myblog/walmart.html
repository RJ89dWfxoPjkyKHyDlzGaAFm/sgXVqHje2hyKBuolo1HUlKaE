<p>All of my relatives who support the Black Lives Matter hate Walmart. My BLM relatives won't shop at Walmart, they only shop at Target. And they don't shop at any Target, they only shop at the Target in White neighborhoods. My Uncle's BLM friend said "Target sells higher quality clothing styles than Walmart. The Target in our neighborhood, the aisles are very disorganized." My BLM sister and her BLM boyfriend said "I don't shop for clothing at Walmart or Target. I only purchase clothing from Nike or Adidas. We save money because Nike and Adidas clothing is higher quality which means it lasts longer." Meanwhile, my BLM sister and her BLM boyfriend purchase counterfeit Gucci bags from Chinatown. My BLM classmate said "If I had more money, I wouldn't choose Nike or Adidas. I prefer Gucci or Louis Vuitton."</p>

<p>My BLM uncle said "Do you want to understand why I hate Walmart? Go on Google Images and search for "People of Walmart Memes." Then, you will understand why I hate Walmart. Walmart customer service is the worst, because Walmart does not pay their employees a liveable wage." My BLM uncle is obsessed with customer service, every weekend he visits a different fancy restaurant because he loves to feel like a king when the waiter is grating his parmesean cheese. My BLM Uncle won't visit the same fancy restaurant twice in one month, he says "Oh no. I'm tired of that restaurant. I want to try something new today." My BLM uncle is so oppressed because he is a connoisseur of fine arts, his bedroom is decorated with a Tron movie poster, vinyl records from Amoeba, Edgar Allan Poe themed paintings, he owns a jar of marijuana, mountains of Adidas, and Nike clothing, he collects concert tickets. My BLM Uncle washes his luxurious delicate bedding material at a Laundromat. My BLM won't visit any Laundromat, he says "Oh no. That laundromat is filled with wretched people. I go to this other Laundromat." The Laundromat he chooses happens to reside in a white neighborhood.</p>

<p>My relatives use that phrase "wretched" a lot. I used context clues to decipher what that phrase entails. I learned "wretched people" is a cryptic phrase that describes low income black people, low income latinos, low income white people, drug addicts, the mentally ill, the homeless, or beggars. Wretched simply means ghetto. And every BLM soldier in my family hates ghetto people. Yes, it's true. BLM latinos are the most racist people of all. They claim to love black people, but they want to live as far away as possible from black people. BLM latinos want to give free housing to the homeless, but they are absolutely repulsed whenever they see a real homeless person. My BLM uncle said to me "Do you see that homeless man standing over there? I don't have proof, but I know it was him. That homeless stole things from my car." Whenever a BLM soldier in my family uses that phrase "wretched people" it means they are about to drive very far away from our ghetto neighborhood to their next destination residing in a White neighborhood to purchase something simple like Mc Donalds, Cinnabon, Krispy Kreme, In N Out, Habitat, or Starbucks. Those are very popular places for BLM Latinos. BLM Latinos love posting instagram photos with their Chanel bag, macbook, iPhone, and In N Out burger #BlackLivesMatter. The latina women with their Chanel bag, the latino men with their BMW vehicle. BLM soldier be like "I love the Lorax by Dr. Suess. Save the trees. Let's end Global Warming. #F**kDonaldTrump." Then their next instagram post is them standing next to their big a*s Christmas tree that somebody chopped down.</p>

<p>My very obese BLM cousin with body tattoos and peircings said "Buckle up, we're going to a far away Starbucks." I asked "Why?" My BLM cousin replied "Because the one in our neighborhood, the employees are wretched, the service is slow, they always get my order wrong, I asked for a cold scone, they gave me a warm one, it ruins the flavor. I work hard for my money. I don't want to stand next to stinky ass thong sandal wearing wretched Walmart people, I don't want to see crackheads doing drugs in the public restroom." My BLM cousin said "How is race a political debate? Everyone deserves equal treatment, it's common sense. Ugh! I hate Donald Trump. I hate White people. White people are inherently evil. If White people ceased to exist, humanity would prosper." And I know why my BLM cousin hates white people. When my BLM cousin was a kid, a latino man molested her. Then, when my BLM cousin was a young adult, she encoutered a charming latino man who sent her flowers and romantic text messages. My BLM cousin and this latino man became romantically involved. Then, one day my BLM cousin gave birth to twins. Immediately, that latino man dissapeared. Overnight, my BLM cousin became a single mother of two children. And somehow all of this is White people's fault.</p>

<p>I don't understand why BLM are obsessed about racist White people. Literally, White people are not the only racist people on Earth. I visited Donut Shop, an asian woman asked "What do you want?" I ordered a Ham and Cheese Croissant. The asian woman asked "Do you want Jalapeno?" I replied "No." The asian women said "I give you jalapeno croissant anyway." The asian woman literally gave me jalapenos because she is racist, she thinks all latino men love jalapenos. And guess what. I ate it, and it was delicious. Now imagine if a white person had asked a black person "Do you want koolaid with your fried chicken?" Then, I walked into a 7/11. Immediately, an Indian rudely shouted at me "What do you want? Beer? Huh? You want beer? It's over there." This Indian man assumed I was an alcoholic because of my skin color, and my baggy clothes. Months later, I was in that same 7/11, I purchased a bottle of Soylent. The Indian man chased after me outside his store, he yelled "You. Did you pay for that? Show me your receipt." Indian people are very racist because in their country they have a caste system. Here are two interesting videos about the "untouchable" in India. Basically, in India instead of Black Lives Matter, they have Dalit Lives Matter.</p>

<p>A latino man at Walmart also judged me because of my skin color, and my street clothes. I was holding a bottle of mouthwash, the latino walmart employee said "You can't pay for that here. Oh wait, is that mouthwash? I thought it was rum. Nevermind, you can go ahead." If a white person was holding mouth, they probably wouldn't have said anything.</p>

<p>When the Black Lives Matter protests began during 2020, a black man said to me "Hey man, I'm really sorry about the protests. Just know not all black people are like this. I still hate white cops, but ain't right to proest like that." A black woman said to me "I'm racist against my own skin color. I don't like hiring black employees. I don't like having black coworkers. Black people are lazy. Black people have attitude issues. And I have attitude issues too. So we clash eachother.  But I still hate the police." A latino man said "I f**king hate all n*****s." A latina woman said "I wish Adolf Hitler would burn all those protesters. They should annihialte all of those degeneratives." And then a latina woman in my neighborhood installed an enormous Trump 2020 flag on her own house.</p>

<p>A latino man once said to me "I don't do jobs for black people. I used to. But I had so many bad experiences. Black people complain too much, they expect the lowest price, and the best service. They don't even pay me. I've heard so many black people say to me "Why are your prices so high? My brother would do this for $20." So I tell them "Okay then you should have called your brother. Goodbye, have a nice day."</p>

<p>A latina elementary school teacher was crying in front of me, she said "One latino student witnessed his own father murder the mother with a shotgun, and then the father committed suicide. Now this latino student lives in a foster home. He misbehaves, but I can handle his antics. My other latino student, he was one of my best students, so well behaved and very intelligent. Then, one day we found out he lived in a car with drug addict parents, he survived many days with only the public school's cafeteria food in his stomach, social services took him away from his parents, now he lives in foster care. The janitor caught two black male students giving oral sex to eachother in the school's bathroom, the black mother said "My son ain't gay." All my black female students are well behaved. It's only my black male students who give me headaches. One black student in particular also lives in a foster home, his parents were drug addicts. I tried so many times to help this black student, but everytime it seems like he behavior improves, he does something that terrifies me. It started off with little things, he would talk, bicker, laugh, and disrupt my class. Then, I caught him stealing candy from me. I said to him "If you wanted candy, I would have given you one, if you asked nicely." He replied "Esteban dared me to do it." I asked Esteban in private, and Esteban said "He dared me to do it. I said no. He called me a f****t." He stole a phone from someone's backpack. He stole these pink slips from the office. We reward our good students with pink slips, which they can use to buy food and drinks. He doesn't care about school like at all. The only thing he cares about is girls, shoes, and gangs. He references his uncle a lot, he says "My uncle taught me how to dance like this. My uncle taught me how to make this gang sign, red is bloods, blue is crips, you gotta be a real n***a to earn respect. I'd rather be feared than be loved." And all my female black students love him. During recess a police car drove by, the black student pointed his middle finger and said "F**k you pig." There is only one time that I ever saw him listening and paying attention to my lesson plan. It was on the day I explained the history of slavery in America. One day he yelled at me "You're just picking on me because I'm black and you're racist!" I replied "I know my skin color is white. But I am actually a latina woman. I am considered a minority." He replied "It doesn't matter you still have white privilege." He doesn't do the pledge of allegiance. Then I heard him say something very sexist. He yelled at a kid "You can call me a n****r. But don't ever call me a b***h." Then, he punched that student. He gives me the most genuine apologies, but then he does violent things. Then, I eavesdropped on a conversation he was having with another student. He asked the latino student "Which girl do you like? What do you think about Angelica?" The latino student replied "Angelica is several grades lower than me. She's too young for me." The black student replied "Oh. That's even better. Did you know that younger girls are easier to f**k. You can manipulate them. What's the matter? You never had sex before?" That is why I am crying today. There is pure evil in that kid. I feel terrified in his presence. He is going to prison one day, and there's nothing I can say or do to help him. I tried. I tried so many times. Every year, I try so many times. Every year, it's always my black male students who misbehave. It's not fair to my other students. I'm crying because I never believed those racist words would come from me. Our students are underperforming, we have a new principal, we are becoming a Title One school. I had one Jewish co-worker, she was my only friend at this school. This Jewish woman told me that when she first moved to this country, she faced housing discrimination in New York, it wasn't that long ago when someone told her "No Jews," to her face. She said California was the only place that accepted her. Now my Jewish co-worker still lives in California, but she doesn't work with me anymore. She changed schools because the black students and black parents kept accussing her of allegedly being a white supremacist. She was our school's best teacher. Now she teaches in a private school."</p>

<p>I know this other latina woman, in her early twenties of age, she began working as a teacher's assisitant at a local elementary school. One day around 2017, she posted a suicide note on Facebook. She drank a bottle of pills. Then, someone on facebook who knew her home address called an ambulance to her home. She survived her suicide attempt. I didn't read her suicide note, she deleted it, but someone who read it, they told me that one reason was because when she started working at that elementary school, she kept hearing sad stories about her students, of kids being abused at home.</p>

<p>I personally remember when I was a very young elementary school student, my teacher asked a student "What happened to your arm?" The kid replied "I fell." The teacher replied "How did you fall down?" The kid replied "On my bike." The next week, he had a scab on his head. The teacher asked "What happened?" The kid replied "I fell." The teacher replied "How did you fall down?" The kid replied "I was chasing a cockroach with my broom." The teacher laughed "Explain to me, how did you hit your head while chasing a cockroach with your broom? Did you fall on something?" Then several weeks later, my teacher ordered everyone in my class to sit down in a circle. My teacher said "Do you remember that one kid? Every week he had a scab on him. He isn't in our class anymore. I feel very sorry because I laughed at his cockroach story. It turns out the reason he had scabs on him is because his parents would torture him to punish him when he misbehaved. He is living in a foster home now."</p>
