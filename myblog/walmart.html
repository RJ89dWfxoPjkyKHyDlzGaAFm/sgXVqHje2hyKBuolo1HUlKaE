<p>All of my relatives who support the Black Lives Matter hate Walmart. My BLM relatives won't shop at Walmart, they only shop at Target. And they don't shop at any Target, they only shop at the Target in White neighborhoods. My Uncle's BLM friend said "Target sells higher quality clothing styles than Walmart. The Target in our neighborhood, the aisles are very disorganized." My BLM sister and her BLM boyfriend said "I don't shop for clothing at Walmart or Target. I only purchase clothing from Nike or Adidas. We save money because Nike and Adidas clothing is higher quality which means it lasts longer." Meanwhile, my BLM sister and her BLM boyfriend purchase counterfeit Gucci bags from Chinatown. My BLM classmate said "If I had more money, I wouldn't choose Nike or Adidas. I prefer Gucci or Louis Vuitton."</p>

<p>My BLM uncle said "Do you want to understand why I hate Walmart? Go on Google Images and search for "People of Walmart Memes." Then, you will understand why I hate Walmart. Walmart customer service is the worst, because Walmart does not pay their employees a liveable wage." My BLM uncle is obsessed with customer service, every weekend he visits a different fancy restaurant because he loves to feel like a king when the waiter is grating his parmesean cheese. My BLM Uncle won't visit the same fancy restaurant twice in one month, he says "Oh no. I'm tired of that restaurant. I want to try something new today." My BLM uncle is so oppressed because he is a connoisseur of fine arts, his bedroom is decorated with a Tron movie poster, vinyl records from Amoeba, Edgar Allan Poe themed paintings, he owns a jar of marijuana, mountains of Adidas, and Nike clothing, he collects concert tickets. My BLM Uncle washes his luxurious delicate bedding material at a Laundromat. My BLM won't visit any Laundromat, he says "Oh no. That laundromat is filled with wretched people. I go to this other Laundromat." The Laundromat he chooses happens to reside in a white neighborhood.</p>

<p>My relatives use that phrase "wretched" a lot. I used context clues to decipher what that phrase entails. I learned "wretched people" is a cryptic phrase that describes low income black people, low income latinos, low income white people, drug addicts, the mentally ill, the homeless, or beggars. Wretched simply means ghetto. And every BLM soldier in my family hates ghetto people. Yes, it's true. BLM latinos are the most racist people of all. They claim to love black people, but they want to live as far away as possible from black people. BLM latinos want to give free housing to the homeless, but they are absolutely repulsed whenever they see a real homeless person. My BLM uncle said to me "Do you see that homeless man standing over there? I don't have proof, but I know it was him. That homeless stole things from my car." Whenever a BLM soldier in my family uses that phrase "wretched people" it means they are about to drive very far away from our ghetto neighborhood to their next destination residing in a White neighborhood to purchase something simple like Mc Donalds, Cinnabon, Krispy Kreme, In N Out, Habitat, or Starbucks. Those are very popular places for BLM Latinos. BLM Latinos love posting instagram photos with their Chanel bag, macbook, iPhone, and In N Out burger #BlackLivesMatter. The latina women with their Chanel bag, the latino men with their BMW vehicle.</p>

<p>My very obese BLM cousin with body tattoos and peircings said "Buckle up, we're going to a far away Starbucks." I asked "Why?" My BLM cousin replied "Because the one in our neighborhood, the employees are wretched, the service is slow, they always get my order wrong, I asked for a cold scone, they gave me a warm one, it ruins the flavor. I don't want to stand next to stinky ass thong sandal wearing wretched Walmart people, I don't want to see crackheads doing drugs in the public restroom." My BLM cousin said "How is race a political debate? Everyone deserves equal treatment, it's common sense. Ugh! I hate Donald Trump. I hate White people. White people are inherently evil. If White people ceased to exist, humanity will become a utopia." And I know why my BLM cousin hates white people. When my BLM cousin was a kid, a latino man molested her. Then, when my BLM cousin was a young adult, she encoutered a charming latino man who sent her flowers and romantic text messages. My BLM cousin and this latino man became romantically involved together. Then, one day my BLM cousin gave birth to twins. Immediately, that latino man dissapeared. Overnight, my BLM cousin became a single mother of two children. And somehow all of this is White people's fault.</p>

<p>I don't understand why BLM are obsessed about racist White people. Literally, White people are not the only racist people on Earth. I visited Donut Shop, an asian woman asked "What do you want?" I ordered a Ham and Cheese Croissant. The asian woman asked "Do you want Jalapeno?" I replied "No." The asian women said "I give you jalapeno croissant anyway." The asian woman literally gave me jalapenos because she is racist, she thinks all latino men love jalapenos. And guess what. I ate it, and it was delicious. Now imagine if a white person had asked a black person "Do you want koolaid with your fried chicken?" Then, I walked into a 7/11. Immediately, an Indian rudely shouted at me "What do you want? Beer? Huh? You want beer? It's over there." This Indian man assumed I was an alcoholic because of my skin color, and my baggy clothes. Months later, I was in that same 7/11, I purchased a bottle of Soylent. The Indian man chased after me outside his store, he yelled "You. Did you pay for that? Show me your receipt." Indian people are very racist because in their country they have a caste system. Here are two interesting videos about the "untouchable" in India. Basically, in India instead of Black Lives Matter, they have Dalit Lives Matter.</p>

<p>A latino man at Walmart also judged me because of my skin color, and my street clothes. I was holding a bottle of mouthwash, the latino walmart employee said "You can't pay for that here. Oh wait, is that mouthwash? I thought it was rum. Nevermind, you can go ahead." If a white person was holding mouth, they probably wouldn't have said anything.</p>

<p>When the Black Lives Matter protests began during 2020, a black man said to me "Hey man, I'm really sorry about the protests. Just know not all black people are like this. I still hate white cops, but ain't right to proest like that." A black woman said to me "I'm racist against my own skin color. I don't like hiring black employees. I don't like having black coworkers. Black people are lazy. Black people have attitude issues. And I have attitude issues too. So we clash eachother.  But I still hate the police." A latino man said "I f**king hate all n*****s." A latina woman said "I wish Adolf Hitler would burn all those protesters. They should annihialte all of those degeneratives." And then there is a latina woman in my neighborhood, she installed an enormous Trump 2020 flag on her own house.</p>
