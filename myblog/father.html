<p>When I was a kid, I witnessed one time my father said to his friend "I purchased an expensive high definition television. Pornography is amazing on it. The details and perspiration of the naked woman's body. I enjoy watching women spreading their legs." My father thought I couldn't understand spanish, that's why he said those things in front of me.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, one time my father introduced me to his relatives, one relative was an old man who grabbed me and said to me "How old you are?" I replied "7 years old." He replied "How many girlfriends do you have?" I replied "Zero." He replied "At your age you should have 7 girlfriends, one for each year." When I was a teenager, my own father told me "How old are you?" I replied "14 years old." My father replied "How many girls are you talking to?" I replied "Zero." My father replied "At your age you should be talking to atleast 5 different girls at the same time. You should be talking to different girls to see which ones you like." I believe this is common in mexican gatherings for there to be a creepy old man asking children the "How many girlfriends do you have?" question. It's like supposed to make intoxicated adults laugh at how stupid children are that they don't even know what is sex yet.</p>

<p>When I was a teenager, one time my father and I were at a Target store, my father noticed the cashier woman's nametag and he said "Hello, Jessica. How are you? Are you working hard? Or hardly working?" The joke is 'hardly working' and 'working hard' sound similar but mean the exact opposite. For years, my father has repeated that same joke to different cashier women. This cashier woman laughed "Haha, I have never heard of that one before." My father replied "Are things busy today?" The cashier woman replied "It's not busy at the moment, that depends on the time of day." My father replied "Does this job pay well?" The cashier woman replied "Yeah, this job pays... But I could always use a little extra money. I would do literally... anything for money." There was a sexual connotation like the woman admitted she was a prostitute. My father replied "I wish I could pay you to clean my house. Or you could clean my son's bedroom. This is my son." My father stood behind me, he squeezed my shoulders with his two hands. It was like my father was selling my virginity to this cashier woman, or paying an escort on my behalf. Many years later, self-checkout machines were becoming popular, my father said to me "I don't like these machines, I prefer a human interaction to greet and welcome me." Knowing my father's history of talking to cashier women, I believe he was disappointed by those machines.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, one time my father, my sister, and I were at a movie theature's parking lot. There was a long spiral staircase to reach the top of a parking lot where our car was parked. When we finally reached our car, my sister said "Dad you are disgusting. There was a woman in front of us going upstairs too, and you were trying to peep underneath her skirt." My dad replied "No, I wasn't. I was searching for your brother." My sister replied "My brother was right behind you." My father replied "Well you see I couldn't see your brother because he was right behind me. I thought I saw him running up stairs."</p>
