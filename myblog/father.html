<h1>Dog Fights</h1>
<p>When I was a kid, my father had a small dog, my father always grabbed the dog by its scruff. My sister said "Dad, can you please be gentle with your dog? Please hold him correctly." My father replied "I have a friend who breeds dogs. This is how dogs carry their young. It's natural. It teaches dogs to be humbled in the presence of humans, because we are the dominant species. To always follow my commands and never question my authority. Otherwise, this dog will beg for food, urinate and deficate in your home, chew on your table and shoes, believing he is the alpha dog."</p>

<p>When I was an adult, my sister and my mother both told me that my father had forced dogs to fight. I asked my father and he said "It was a very long time ago. It wasn't my dogs. I was only the host and referee. I never allowed a dog to die. There was only a tiny amount of blood. It was a different era back then. At the time, I didn't think dogs had feelings. I don't regret anything. However, I would never do that ever again. Today, I am an animal activist." I asked my father "Do you know anyone who is currently hosting dog fights today?" My  doing dog fights. I get along with anyone. I can't judge them."</p>

<h1>Argument</h1>
<p>When I was a young adult, my father called me and said he wanted to see me. We were talking, sitting in his car, and my father said "Let's have dinner with your sister." I replied "No. I don't want to." My father replied "Why do you hate your sister so much?" I replied "My sister is evil. She mistreats her dogs." My father replied "No matter what, dogs are animals. Dogs don't feel emotions like humans do. You can always buy a new dog, but you can't buy a new sister. No matter what, you should always love your family. Family is the most important thing. I don't care if your sister is in prison, you always have to love your family. We are going to have dinner with your sister today." I didn't say anything. My father continued "I love you so much my son, can you please be in a selfie with me?" I replied "No. I don't want to be in your photo." My father replied "Why are you like this? Okay. I understand. You are going through things. But we're still going to have dinner with your sister." My father started driving to my sister's house, and I got very angry spontaneously, so I opened my father's car door in the middle of the road and left him, my father grabbed my arm and said "Stay here!" I managed to pull away from his grasp. I had to walk home a very long way home. My father texted me dozens of times "What did I do wrong? Please, answer me." After that I never talked to my father ever again.</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>I was angered about my father. It was nothing personal. I did not want to see or talk to my sister. Also, I felt annoyed because my father rarely sees me, but everytime he sees me, he pretends to be my bestfriend. I know almost nothing about him, he knows almost nothing about me, we are complete strangers. My father was never when I had anger issues as a kid, and I was running away from home. My father was never there when my sister was addicted to methamphetamine, and I was just a kid seeing cops at my house and yelling. Ever since I was a kid, my father wanted to be in selfie photos with me. My father said he doesn't post our photos online, he only shows our photos to his relatives, because he is proud to be my father. He is not my father, he is a sperm donor.</p>

<h1>Perversion</h1>
<p>When I was a kid, I witnessed my father saying to his friend "I purchased the latest high definition television. Pornography is amazing on it. I enjoy watching women spread their legs and all that wetness." My father thought I couldn't understand spanish, that's why he said those things in front of me.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, my father introduced me to his relatives, one relative was an old man who grabbed me and said to me "Young boy, how old you are?" I replied "9 years old." He replied "How many girlfriends do you have?" I replied "Zero." He replied "At your age you should have 9 girlfriends, one for each year." I believe this is common in mexican gatherings for there to be a creepy old man asking children the "How many girlfriends do you have?" question. It's like supposed to make drunk adults laugh at how stupid children are for not yet understanding the concept of sex.</p>

<p>When I was a teenager, my father and I were at a Target store, my father noticed the cashier woman's nametag and he said "Hello, Jessica. How are you? Are you working hard? Or hardly working?" The joke was 'hardly working' and 'working hard' sound very similar but means the exact opposite. For years, my father had repeated that same joke to different cashier women. This cashier woman laughed "Haha, I have never heard of that one before." My father replied "Are things busy today?" The cashier woman replied "It's not busy at the moment, that depends on the time of day." My father replied "Does this job pay well?" The cashier woman replied "Yeah, this job pays... I still wish I had more money though." My father replied "I wish I could pay you to clean my house." The cashier woman replied "If you paid me enough, I would clean your car." My father replied "We could arrange that in this parking lot." The woman replied "I would do literally... anything for money." There was a sexual connotation like the woman admitted she was a prostitute. My father replied "You should clean my son's bedroom. This is my son." My father stood behind me, he squeezed my shoulders with his two hands. It was like my father was selling my virginity to this cashier woman, or paying an escort on my behalf. Then, as we were walking away my father said "I forgot my phone in my car, I will take on your offer at another time." To this day I still wonder, how did my father know he could talk to that woman like that. I wonder if they knew eachother, or if this was a joke. And I wonder if my father ever went back and found that woman again. My father was married, so I wondered what message my father was sending me. I wondered if my father's marriage was an open-relationship. And that same day was when my father took my phone and said "Let me see your phone. I want to see how many girls are you talking to. At your age you should be talking to a lot of different girls. Now, I am not saying they all have to be your girlfriends at the same time. Just talk to different girls, and see which ones do you like, have casual conversations with them. It's a part of your development. Don't be weird. Don't be antisocial." On a different occassion, my father gave me a test, he took me to a Subway restaurant and told me "I just want to make sure you're not weird. Go order a sandwich. I'll watch you from here." I ordered a sandwich and I said to my father "How did I do?" My father was staring at his smartphone and he replied "What?" I replied "You weren't paying attention?!" My father replied "Ah, I forgot. Whatever. Just... You got your sandwich. You did good." Many years later, self-checkout machines were becoming popular, my father said to me "I don't like these machines, I prefer a human interaction." Knowing my father's history of talking to cashier women, I believe he was very disappointed by those machines.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, one time my father, my sister, and I were at a movie theature's parking lot. There was a long spiral staircase to reach the top of a parking lot where our car was parked. When we finally reached our car, my sister said "Dad you are disgusting. There was a woman in front of us going upstairs too, and you were trying to peep underneath her skirt." My dad replied "No, I wasn't. I was searching for your brother." My sister replied "My brother was right behind you." My father replied "Well you see I couldn't see your brother because he was right behind me. I thought I saw him running up stairs."</p>

<p>When I was a kid, my father, my sister, and I were at a hospital. My sister said "Dad, can I please borrow your phone, I have to call my mom for information. My dad replied "Okay hold on." My sister snatched the phone right out of my father's hand and she left the room. My sister came back and said "Ew! Dad, you're so disgusting! I saw your naked photos on your phone!"</p>

<h1>Mansion Estate</h1>
<p>When I was a kid, I lived with my mother in a ghetto neighborhood. My father lived in a mansion. On legal visits, my father took me to his house. I am going to describe my father's mansion.</p>
 
<p>The backyard pool was made of cement. The water was clear except for a few leaves. There was a jacuzzi, a sand filter, and lounge chairs for sunbathing, security cameras, automatic dishwasher, tall ceilings. The curtains were heavy like carpets. There was a television in the kitchen. The dinner table was made of cold marble, it had tall swiveling metal chairs. There was a small walk in closet that functioned like a grocery store, it maintained rice, beans, water bottles, candy, potato chips, canned food, noodles, etc. There was a tiny bartending room, only one person could stand in there, but it had a tiny refrigerator of alcoholic beverages. There was a garage, and no one was living in it, it was just cars. And all the cars were brand new, recent models. There was a room of only a punching bag and dumbells. There was a room of only a billiard table, it's walls had different sizes of cue sticks. There was a room of only an iMac computer, a paper shredder, and a swiveling chair.</p>

<p>When my father and mother divorced, my father eventually married a different woman who already had 3 children. Her children became my father's step children. My father's step children were teenagers when I first met them, but all those teenagers talked about was college, university, and careers. One time, they were discussing parent conferences, and my father's wife said "Gene Simmons was there. He did that tongue thing. It was disgusting." One time, my father gave his wife a box. She opened it, but it was a box within a box, within a box. One box for each year they were together. In the end, there was a black box with a diamond ring.</p>

<p>One time, my father's wife said "Someone stole my daughter's car. We have it on video." The video was that her sons and daughter were driving under the influence. They parked their car on the driveway. They stumbled around looking for keys to the house. It took them a very long time, but eventually they went inside the house. Immediately, a person wearing a hoodie walked to the car, and within seconds he quickly unlocked the car door and drove away with it. It appears he used a metal stick to unlocked the car door. Then my father's wife said "We also caught a ghost on camera." The video was at midnight, the camera was in grayscale night vision mode, a glowing orb flew over their cement pool, the video bloomed, the orb lingered above the pool for a few minutes, then flew away into the sky and vanished. I don't believe in ghosts. It was probably like a spec of dust or something.</p>

<p>As a kid, I never realized how incredibly messed up it was what my father did to me. He literally abandoned me in a ghetto neighborhood with my incompetent mother. Meanwhile, he had an entire other family in a mansion preparing them for college. Their children went to a High School where celebrities sent their own children to. It was so messed up. Everytime I saw my father, he would brag about how much money he earns, but he seemed humble. He said "Look at the photos on my phone, I went to Mexico. I ordered a box of toys from Amazon, and I gave out free soccer balls and toys to all the children in my town. I grew up poor. I never had toys. This would have made me happy as a kid. Believe it or not, these toys seem stupid to you, but it means the world to them." Meanwhile, my father never paid child support to my own mother! I was lucky if he gave me $20.</p>

<h1>Child Support</h1>
<p>I know I always say that my father never paid child support. Truth is he paid probably like 12 months worth of child support, and then he completely stopped. So I meant my father never fully paid child support. I only remember one specific time he paid child support, it hurt him so much. He wrote a check of $180 for me and $180 for my sister around christmas time. Combined it was $360. I was just a kid. I didn't know what to do with that money. The very next day my crackhead sister took me to the mall shopping center, and she told me "Buy yourself clothes." She took me to Abercrombie & Fitch, I said "I don't know what to buy." My sister said "Buy this sweater and these shirts." And just like that all my money was gone. I had purchased there the ugliest sweater, it was already torn, the shirts were already faded. Then outside my sister's friend said to me "Oh your brother broke his A&F virginity." I was so happy. I thought I was spending quality time with my sister. As a kid, I didn't realize my sister was high on methamphetamine the entire time.</p>
