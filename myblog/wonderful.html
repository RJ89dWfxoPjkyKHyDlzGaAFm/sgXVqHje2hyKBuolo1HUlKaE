<p>Someone wrote a fictional short story titled "It's a Wonderful Race, After All <a href="https://www.stormfront.org/forum/t106774/">[1]</a> <a href="https://gawker.com/the-creative-writing-of-the-internets-premier-white-sup-1770239755">[2]</a>." On this page I summarize that story, in my own words for your convenience with major plot spoilers.</p>

<p>Summary: A liberal college student named George gets into a verbal political debate about racism with his conservative father. In the end of that debate, George exclaims "Us white people owe reparations to the minorites. Us white people are the oppressors. Humanity would be better off if white people never existed." That same night, George falls asleep, and George wakes up in a barren North America where George suddenly sees a strange figure in the sky. George asked "Where am I? Am I dead? What is this place? Is that you God?" The spirit replies "No, I am not God. I am God's angel named Clarence. This is Earth if white people never existed. I'll show you around." George asks to see the Native Americans, the Incas, the Africans, the Indians, and the Japanese. George realized everywhere he goes, without white people there are no comforts of computers, machinery, nor medicine, and so without white people human existence means constant war and struggle to survive. Now just as George is becoming the next victim of an old fashioned barbaric human sacrifice at the hands of some African tribe, just as the spear is going to puncture George's stomach, George wakes up from this nightmare. George apologizes to his conservative father, and George resents his liberal college professors.</p>
