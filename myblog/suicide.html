<p>I don't recommend any of this. I'm not an expert. I'm not a scientist. I am just a random dude on the internet. They will probably ban my website for this.</p>

<p>Tara Condell was 27 years old when she died by suicide hanging. Tara Condell posted a suicide note on her website, you can read it here <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190902200946/https://www.taracondell.com/">[1]</a>.

<p>Terminal Dehydration, you stop drinking water and stop eating food until you die. Some scientists did an experiment where they injected patients with water into their veins. It was learned that if you inject water into the a human's veins, it did not quench thirst, patients still felt very thirsty. The hypothesis is that the sensation of a liquid on your palate, and throat is what signals to your brain whether you are thirsty. Therefore, when attempting this method it may help to rinse your mouth with water, and spit the water out. Research on Terminal Dehydration is mainly done on old people and cancer patients who wish to die, but had no other options left due to legal restrictions. It has been said that Terminal Dehyration is a painless way to die, long as you are high on some euphoriant drug. You can probably drink vodka, because ethanol is a known diuretic, you dehydrate faster due to the frequent urination. It is very important that you do not eat any food, eating food could result in a slow and painful death.</p>

<p>Exsanguination, you bleed to death. According to wikipedia, death would occur when you lose 1/3 to 2/3 of your blood. On average, 7% of the human's body weight is blood. The average 180 pound human holds 201.6 ounces of blood. You should aim to bleed out 67.2 ounces to 134.4 ounces of blood. Some people told me, that you would not simply cut your wrists like in the movies. Apparently, you would need to really tear open your skin, until you puncture some major artery to draw this much blood. At this point, you would be staring at your arm bones.</p>  

<p>Pentobarbital, is a drug that allegedly results in a peaceful death. Veterinarians euthanize animals with this drug. The U.S. Government used it to euthanized criminals. Apparently, pentobarbital is in a category called barbiturates, it puts you to sleep, you lose consicousness, prevents your body from feeling any pain, and then your muscles are so very relaxed that your heart and lungs stops pumping, and then you die. Philosophers and liberals have argued there is no way of knowing if this drug is really painless. It is most likely painless like anesthesia. Anyways, pentobarbital is very illegal, practically impossible to acquire legally anywhere in the world. Pentobarbital is reserved only for licensed doctors. However, there are rumors that if you go to Mexico, you can walk into some pet store, they might sell you pentobarbital if you asked "something to euthanize my very sick horse." Interestingly, pentobarbital has been found in dog food, because of dead horse meat <a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-does-a-euthanasia-drug-keep-ending-up-in-dog-food-1823186412">[2]</a>. Also, don't even try to purchase pentobarbital from the internet, they are all scams. If you do manage to acquire pentobarbital somehow, you would need to drink 10 grams. 10 grams of pentobarbital is the standard dose to euthanize a human via oral administartion.</p>

<p>Next, I have to explain inert gas asphyxiation, amygdalin, over-the-counters, potassium chloride, ketamine, and fentanyl.</p>
