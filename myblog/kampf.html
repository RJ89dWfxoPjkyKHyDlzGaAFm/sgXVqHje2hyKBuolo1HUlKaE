<p>"Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events. Small minds discuss people." Some of you are not easily convinced by facts and logic, but you require stories to form your world view. This section is dedicated to you small minded people. Henry Winkler described the art of story telling as "We illuminate life, I mean that's the reason that we do what we do, is that we hold a mirror up to the rest of society. <span aria-hidden="true"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/yz0bjLk9rUo?t=155">1</a>"</span> I am not venting with my stories, but I selected these stories as to illuminate the reader.</p>

<p>For example, I grew up watching Law & Order, and an episode really impacted me when the detective said "You're going to prison for drug charges," the suspect replied "What difference will that make? I am already a prisoner in my own body." The suspect was a bedridden disabled person. During my youth, I missed out on a significant portion of my life due to chronic pain, I truly felt like I was "a prisoner in my own body." That episode gave reconciliation to my suffering. When I watch television, I am seeing aspects of my own personality in those characters.</p>

<p>In Law & Order SVU, a suspect said "When I was a teenager, a man raped me. Now I am a grown adult, I rarely leave my home, I take the trash out only late at night to avoid seeing people, I work from home, I order all my food online, because I am afraid of being hurt again like the way that man hurt me." And when I was a teenager, a latino adult man showed me his penis and told me "suck it." I replied "No way dude, I am leaving." The latino adult man replied "You seemed so nice, I thought you were gay. Well if you're not going to suck it, then I will find a prostitute, a dog, cat or any animal hahaha." He was laughing at the idea of raping an innocent stray animal.</p>

<p>And on a separate occasion, when I was a teenager, a latino adult man attempted to rape me. I was at a public park smoking marijuna with my friend. My friend said to me "Is it okay if I bring another friend?" I replied "Go ahead." His friend was the latino adult man. The latino adult man told me "Can you please sell me some of your marijuana?" I replied "Alright." The latino man snatched my bag of marijuana and walked away with it while telling me "Follow me, there might be cops watching us here." I followed him. I watched him turn a corner. He dissapeared. When I reached the corner, suddenly I was surrounded by a group of latino teenagers, their heads were shaved, they wore oversized white t shirts. I recognized one teenager was a latino peer from my High School, and it made me feel safe. Suddenly the latino adult man said "Go in there," I looked at where he pointed, and it was the park's public restroom. Suddenly, I realized what might happen if I went in the bathroom. I replied "No way dude, I am leaving." But it was too late. The latino adult man grabbed my shirt, punched my face several times, and creepily told me "You don't even know what I was gonna to do to you." The other teenagers each punched me too. One teenager brandished a knife, and that is why I did not use my skateboard as a weapon, and instead I skated away. As I was skating away, a low rider vehicle began revving its engine very loudly on the public road. The latino low riders witnessed my assault, and the violence made them excited. I felt like the low riders were following me. So I skated to the nearest fast food restaurant instead of going home. As I was eating, I kept thinking about what the latino adult man said to me "You don't even know what I was gonna do to you." It means he was going to rape me. After that, everywhere I visited, I kept seeing the latino adult man, not in reality, but in my imagination. Every face I witnessed, it was the same latino adult man's sweaty beady eyes. Suddenly, every human I encountered was potentionally a rapist. Do you want to know what a rapist looks like? I saw his eyes. A rapist looks like a normal person. It could be your friend, cousin, parent, celebrity, stranger, significant other. A rapist could be literally anyone.</p>

<p>So that is why I don't support Black Lives Matter. Because I keep hearing stories about mexicans raping other mexicans. And I keep hearing "It's because mexcicans are oppressed. White people steal from us. We have all the worst teachers. White supremacy is the problem." What the fuck does white supremacy have to do with rape? I am sick and tired of hearing "the cops killed an innocent person." According to RAINN, 97.5% sexual assaulters never go to prison for sexual assault charges, 96.7% of physical assaulters never go to prison for physical assault. And yet every rape story I encountered always ends with "The mexican rapist ran away to mexico, we never seen or heard from them ever again," or "The mexican rapist never went to prison for rape charges, but he instead went to prison for minor drug offenses. After prison, he ran away to mexico, we never seen or heard from them ever again." There is a reaon why they run away to mexico. When Donald Trump said “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” That's exactly what I believe. My name is Jovanny Rodriguez, I am mexican-american.</p>
