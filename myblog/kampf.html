<p>My name is Jovanny Rodriguez. My mother was born in Yucatan, Mexico. My father was born in Jalisco, Mexico. I was born and raised in California, USA. I have only one older sister who is 5 years older than me. These are the stories that influenced my opinions. These are drafts. I will try to organize and catergorize.</p>

<p>1. <a href="divorce.html">My Parents' Divorce</a></p>
<p>2. <a href="fraud.html">Insurance Fraud</a></p>
<p>3. <a href="oppressed.html">Are They Oppressed?</a></p>
<p>Right now I am trying to write a very long story. It's complicated to explain, so many parts.</p>
