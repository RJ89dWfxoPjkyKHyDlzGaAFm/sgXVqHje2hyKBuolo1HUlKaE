<p>Early one morning, this male truck driver encountered a stranded woman upon a long deserted interstate road. The woman said "My car engine died. Would you please drive me to the city?" The male truck driver agreed to help. As they were traveling, the woman said "My parents are expecting my arrival. I am thankful you were there after I waited several hours. My car engine died last night. I was so exhausted from driving that I fell asleep waiting for help. So my name is Caroline." The truck driver replied "I'm Nicholas. I'm supposed to deliver this shipment of Alfalfa Hay." The woman replied "That's so cool! My parents used to grow Timothy Hay!" The truck driver and the woman talked less than an hour. The truck driver stared at the road noticing the beautiful scenery and cow pasture. The truck driver's attention returned towards the woman but the woman was gone, she dissapeared, vanished.</p>
  
<p>The truck driver remembered how the woman said "My friend started a bakery nearby a cemetery." When the truck driver arrived to the city, he drove to the nearest cemetery where there was a bakery. The truck drive asked "Is there a woman named Caroline who works here?" The employees there replied "No." The next day, two police officers arrived at the truck driver's house. The officers said "Did you visit a bakery recently?" The truck driver answered all their questions. When the officers left, the truck driver typed "Caroline Interstate 9" on an internet search engine and learned that Caroline is a woman who died 10 years ago, she was brutally killed on interstate 9. Her killer was never found. So this is the story of Caroline whose ghost is still out there trying to return to her family...</p>

<p>I might rewrite this story to make it so that she died from a car accident that way in the end I can say her ghost is still out there perpetually trying to return to her family... The only problem is like what do I say? The truck driver found her next to a flipped over car or something? She would be covered in blood like that's not mysterious enough for me... Or like was the girl walking in the middle of nowhere with no car? That's too unrealistic... And like what caused her accident? An animal? which animal?</p>

<p>Early one morning, this male truck driver encountered a stranded woman upon a long deserted interstate road. The woman said "Would you please drive me to the city?" The male truck driver agreed to help. While they traveled together, the truck driver asked "Why were you in the middle of nowhere?" The woman replied "A random deer appeared and it drove me into a ditch. I was stuck. I figured since I ran a marathon before I could probably walk to the city. My parents are expecting me for the holidays. I am so thankful you found me. So my name is Caroline." The truck driver replied "I'm Nicholas. I didn't see any cars back there. I'm supposed to deliver this shipment of home improvement supplies." The woman said "Yeah it's not a big deal. I love animals. I hated that car anyways. That outdated car I don't think it would pass a smog check." The truck driver and the woman talked less than an hour. The truck driver stared at the road noticing the beautiful scenery and cow pasture. The truck driver's attention returned towards the woman but the woman was gone, she dissapeared, vanished.</p>
