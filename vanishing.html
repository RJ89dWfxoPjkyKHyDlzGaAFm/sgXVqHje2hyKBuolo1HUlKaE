<p>Early one morning, this male truck driver encountered a stranded woman upon a long deserted road. The woman said "My car engine died. Would you please drive me to the city?" The male truck driver agreed to help. As they were travelling, the woman said "My parents are expecting my arrival. I am thankful you were there after I waited several hours. My car engine died last night. I was so exhausted from driving that I fell asleep in my car waiting for another car to passby."
