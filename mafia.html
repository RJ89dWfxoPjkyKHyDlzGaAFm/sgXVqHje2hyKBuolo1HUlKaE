<p>My ideas are over the place... Where here goes...</p>

<p>I never thought I was going to be one of those crazy conspiracy theorists...</p>

<p>I would listen to three podcasts, David Dobrik's podcast, Ethan Klein's podcast, and Robert Evan's podcast. Casey Neistat told David Dobrik "When I was a kid, my dream was to never fly coach, and now my dream has come true, but it was never about the money." And I said to myself "When I was a kid, I wanted world peace." Robert Evans and Ethan Klein both say "I am against the death penalty" but yet they are always wishing death to people. And then</p>

<p>He says jews are more oppressed than blacks. He says "If you say the N, the whole world cancels you. But if you call someone a greedy jew, both the left and the right come to support you. Jews and blacks must join forces to kill all white people," and "If you are my number one fan, you will bomb the NRA for me," and "If you are my number one fan, you will ship sh*t to Nick Lee's house."</p>

<p>He ruined Patrice Wilson's life, because Ethan kept calling him a pedophile.</p>

<p>It gets worse. Ethan Klein is literally Satan. Go on r/Frenemies3 and you will see. When Trisha Paytas was a little girl, a teacher touched her boobs. And Ethan Klein tweeted "Trisha is lying," to make Trisha seem like crazy. All this only because Trisha is allegedly "anti-semitic."</p>

<p>This girl made a two hour movie all about how Trisha Paytas is anti-semitic.</p>

<p>I am sure you have seen these crazy people all over reddit.com who are obsessed with Trisha Paytas. They are trying to ruin her life, threatening to kill her baby, stalking her, all sorts of crazy sh*t, ONLY because Trisha is allegedly "anti-semitic."</p>
