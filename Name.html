<h1>Name</h1>
 <p>A human named emily produced her first offspring during 2008, name Anthony. By 2016, Anthony had a life of his own. On day Anthony asked his grandmother "Can I please have a parakeet? Like the ones we saw at the flea market?" His grandmother said "What an excellent idea!"</p>
 <p>The grandmother had a son named James, who was intending to kill himself soon. An audible conversation caused James to exit his bedroom. Upon the living room, James saw Anthony and the grandmother greeting a new guest of the houshold. The new guest was a parakeet bird. James was dissapointed.</p>
  
  <p>James predicted this parakeet wouldn't live happily at the mercy of Anthony and the grandmother. One day James asked "What ever happened to the parakeet you supposedly purchased at the flea market?" The grandmother replied, "It's outside!" James was about to have a happy change of heart, but was instead dissapointed when he opened the door witnessing the parakeet was scorching upon the hot summery sunlight without a shade and all its drinking water has evaporated away. The parakeet was painfully chirping in its cage, but nobody could hear it while the household door was closed. All the millet had turned to hulls. The grandmother said "How lovely when the bird sings, it must be very happy." James replied "No. This bird could never be happy with you as the owner."</p>

 <p>That was how James adopted Anthony and the grandmother's parakeet. James frequented a local pet store, becoming acquainted with an employee there. One day the employee asked "I apologize, what did you say your parakeet's name was again?" James replied "It doesn't have a name." The employee appeared concerned before saying "Oh, I remember you said that. I have known you several months now, but you still haven't given your parakeet a name. I think you are afraid of naming your parakeet, just as you are afraid of accepting love. You are fearful that one day your bird will leave you, that one day your bird will die." James stopped frequenting the local pet store, instead goes to a far away pet store where nobody known his name.</p>
