<h1>No. 1<br>Wake Up</h1>
<p>You have been told many lies, both about your own people and about others.</p>
<p>You were told that there are no biologically distinct races among the human population.</p>
<p>You were told that all people are exactly the same in every way, from potential height to potential intelligence. You were told that any difference between one group of people and the next is purely a result of environmental factors. You believed these lies because they were told to you at a very young age by people whom you trusted and who probably believed them themselves. You believed these lies because it was easier to go along than to argue. You believed these lies because you wanted to be a good person.</p>
<p>Our people - white people - are suffering. We are being driven further and further toward the margins of the societies which our ancestors built, and when we are finally pushed out completely, there will be nowhere else for us to go. Your fellow whites are your mothers and fathers, your sons and daughters, your brothers and sisters. They are your family. You were told that to think of your race as your family is wrong - not just factually but morally. This, too, was a lie, intended to strip you of your connection to your people.</p>
<p>Your history is being twisted, degraded, and rewritten before your very eyes. Your ancient heroes are being torn down as “racists,” unworthy of your respect or admiration. The achievements of your people are being attributed to others in an attempt to convince you that your past is not worth preserving and that your people are not worth saving. Your children are being taught from as early as kindergarten that to be white is to be the beneficiary of centuries of oppression. All of this is a lie.</p>
<p>You no longer have the luxury of believing these lies.</p>
<p>If we do not act now, while there are still enough of us left to do something about it, our people will go extinct. Our family will cease to exist, and everything that our family built will go with us. If we choose not to act, we choose to condemn our children and our grandchildren; if we are complicit in our own oppression, we are complicit in theirs, as well.</p>
<p>There are powerful people who do not want you to read this. They want you to remain ignorant of what is happening. They want you to believe their lies and to never consider that they might not have your best interests at heart. They have conditioned you to dismiss any idea which goes against their orthodoxy. For the sake of your family, you must overcome that conditioning.</p>
<p>In this series, I intend to condense materials which have been spread out over numerous books, websites, and articles into a single document while keeping it short enough to read in one sitting. You can think of this document as a brief summary of the arguments in favor of the nationalist movement. These essays can be read individually or together, but they will have the most impact when read in order.</p>
<p>Wake up. Your people need you.</p>
<h1>No. 2<br>Race Is Real</h1>
<p>The existence of distinct races among the human population has only recently been disputed. In fact, this truth is so obvious that newborn infants are able to identify and show preference for their own kind. Most people throughout history have recognized the existence of race, and today, most experts outside of the United States and the European Union agree that it is a valid scientific concept​ <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1548-1433.2009.01076.x">[1]</a>​. It is only through the use of extensive propaganda that we in the West have been fooled into believing that there is no difference between a sub-Saharan African man and a Japanese woman.</p>
<p>Human populations developed in separate environments and were subject to radically different environmental pressures. Taking as a starting point that evolution is real and that our own species is not exempt from its effects, the idea that those populations would have evolved in the exact same way is preposterous. We can see differences expressed in skin color and bone structure; this is not in dispute. Nobody argues that a man with dark brown skin and a woman with dark brown skin are just as likely to have an offspring with dark brown skin as they are to have an offspring with pale pink skin. In that instance, we all accept that people from different areas of the planet have adapted in different ways in response to their environments and that those adaptations are carried in the DNA and passed from generation to generation.</p>
<p>When it comes to psychological and emotional qualities, however, we are confronted with a radical skepticism. Do not forget that like skin color, intelligence and personality are derived from our physical bodies: our brains and our hormones. These things are not immune to evolutionary pressure. Just as two populations, over many generations, developed different skin tones in response to different environments, so too would they have developed differently in their cognitive abilities. To believe otherwise would be to go against everything we know about the origin and development of species.</p>
<p>This is not only logically consistent with what we know about evolution, it is backed up by decades of research. The genetic differences among whites, blacks, Amerindians, Asians, and other groups have been shown to be as large as or larger than the differences among subspecies of other animals such as bears, wolves, and dogs; these other animals have developed these subspecies in a shorter time frame than we humans have developed our separate races​ <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.mehy.2009.07.046">[2]</a>. Despite what you have been told by propagandists, these differences in the human genome do indeed cluster along racial lines. You are virtually guaranteed to have more genetic similarity to someone of your own race than to someone of another race​ <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1086/368061">[3]</a>​.</p>
<p>Race is real; there is no room for argument on this point. Those who would tell you that there are no distinct human races have an ulterior motive: to make you believe that your people are not your people, that in fact you have no people, and that your preference for your own people is not only illogical but morally wrong. Do not believe it.</p>
<h1>No. 3<br>Race and IQ</h1>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, it has been repeatedly shown that there is a large gap between the average IQ of a black person and that of a white person​ <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=s4CKqxi6yWIC&lpg=PP1&vq=279&pg=PA279#v=onepage&q&f=false">[4]</a>. This gap is not caused by economic differences; in fact, the test scores of whites who live in abject poverty are higher on average than those of even the wealthiest blacks​ <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12754952630443950486&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5">[5]</a>. The gap is not caused by cultural bias in testing. The truth is exactly the opposite: the more cultural knowledge that is included on a test, the more the racial gap shrinks​ <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/0191-8869(87)90029-8">[6]</a>​. No reasonable explanation for the racial IQ gap exists except one: that the various races of humanity are genetically predisposed to different levels of intelligence.</p>
<p>IQ is not a meaningless measure; it is based on the theory that there is a general underlying intelligence which informs a person’s success in every mental task. This theory was formulated by Charles Spearman when he observed that a person who excelled at one task tended to do well at many others. Spearman and his successors set out to design a test which would measure this general intelligence factor. Over many years, they developed what we know today as the IQ test. It is neither random nor arbitrary; it presents the test taker with tasks that have been shown over thousands of iterations to be the best predictors of general success.</p>
<p>IQ is not a weak measure; in fact, in spite of rabid opposition, it is the most validated measure in all of psychology. No other concept in the field of psychology has endured as much scrutiny as IQ, and yet it endures. It endures precisely because it works. This is not to say that IQ is the only factor in predicting a person’s success at various tasks, but it is the largest factor​ <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.intell.2006.09.004">[7]</a>​. We also know that IQ is heritable​ <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=DwO4TtKAiCoC&lpg=PA101&pg=PA255#v=snippet&q=incontrovertible&f=false">[8]</a>​ and that it regresses to the racial mean intergenerationally. In other words, no matter how exceptional a particular individual is, their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren will eventually return to the average of their race​ <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1037/1076-8971.11.2.235">[9]</a>​.</p>
<p>A person’s IQ is correlated with a wide variety of outcomes​ <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.intell.2006.09.004">[7]</a>. It is positively correlated with success in education; this should be obvious. It is also positively correlated with a person’s lifetime wealth accumulation. IQ is negatively correlated with criminality and with aggression.</p>
<p>This means that not only are people with a lower IQ more likely than those with a higher IQ to commit a crime, the crimes committed by a person with a lower IQ are likely to be more violent and destructive. Beyond even criminality, a lower-IQ population will be more aggressive in their everyday interactions than a higher-IQ one. Criminals are just the most extreme end of the spectrum; there will be more hostility at every level of the lower-IQ population.</p>
<p>Knowing, as we do, the value of IQ in determining the intelligence, wealth, aggression, and criminality of a population, and knowing, as we do, the connection between race and IQ, the explanation for the racial gaps in all of these areas becomes obvious. Blacks are more aggressive, more criminal, less intelligent, and less wealthy than whites because of their genetic predisposition to having a lower IQ than a white population. This is not opinion and it is not judgment; it is fact.</p>
<h1>No. 4<br>The Legacy of Slavery</h1>
<p>One supposed crime for which white Americans are eternally expected to atone is the institution of slavery. We are told that slavery was a terrible injustice committed exclusively by white Europeans against unsuspecting natives across the globe. We are told that the slaves who were brought across the Atlantic to work on American plantations were beaten, whipped, raped, and then beaten again. We are told that it was this slave labor that enabled the economic success of the United States of America. None of this is true.</p>
<p>There is a popular misconception that Europeans sailed to Africa and proceeded to enslave the peaceful people whom they found there, that our ancestors ran around the jungles of Africa with giant nets, capturing the native blacks and dragging them kicking and screaming back to our ships. Nothing could be further from the truth. The slave trade in Africa was alive and booming long before Europeans ever purchased a single slave. Slave empires flourished in Africa for centuries; their largest clients were their Middle Eastern neighbors. Even at its height, the Atlantic slave trade only ever accounted for five percent of the entire African slave trade​ <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/how-many-slaves-landed-in-the-us/">[10]</a>​.</p>
<p>The slaves purchased by Europeans and taken to the Americas were given a better life than they ever would have had if Europeans had never laid eyes on Africa’s shores. Their choices were not to be a slave in America or to be free in Africa; their choices were to be a slave in America or to be a slave elsewhere. In America, slaves worked only a little harder than a farmer works today​ <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s12114-015-9221-6">[11]</a>​. They were given food and housing. They were punished only in response to what would have been considered a crime because they were exempt from the normal justice system. Eventually they were freed and allowed to become our countrymen.</p>
<p>When white Europeans engaged in the African slave trade, they were doing what every other civilization throughout history had done. Whites did not invent slavery, and they were never the largest consumers of slaves. When it comes to slavery, the only unique thing about white people is that we ended it. We didn’t just end it in our own countries, we ended it in every country we visited. We did not end it with the help of the rest of the world but against the opposition of the rest of the world. Anyone who lays the blame for slavery at the feet of the people who single-handedly ended it is either beyond stupid or malicious in the extreme.</p>
<p>Middle Eastern nations do not have a significant black population because they castrated their male slaves upon arrival and then worked them to death. Our reward for ending slavery and then accepting former slaves as our fellow countrymen has been generations of hate, resentment, and abuse. Blacks in America are and always have been among the wealthiest people on the planet, but that’s not enough for them. They will take everything we have until we are destitute and dead and then they will ask for more.</p>
<p>Every black person in America needs to think very seriously about what lesson they want us to learn from this. Our generosity has its limits.</p>
<h1>No. 5<br>White Privilege</h1>
<p>In our society, white people have the privilege of being the only race against whom it is legal to discriminate. “Affirmative action” is the code phrase for anti-white discrimination, and it is pervasive.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, the British Broadcasting Corporation, which is a publicly funded institution, explicitly states that positions are “only open to candidates from a black, Asian or non-white ethnic minority background​ <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/885434/bbc-trainee-job-advert-open-to-non-white-applicants-only">[12]</a>.” In the United States, there is a nationally recognized “Black History Month” which celebrates the meager accomplishments of black people throughout history, yet any mention of white history, white pride, or white solidarity is met with hostility and scorn. Our universities admit black and hispanic students with much lower test scores than white students, and once at university, black and hispanic students are given opportunities and support which white students must go without. There is the Association of Latino Professionals for America, the Latino Law Student Association, the African Students' Association, the Black Student Union, and countless others. If whites were to attempt to similarly organize, however, we would face censure, expulsion, termination, and litigation.</p>
<p>All of this is justified by the concept of “white privilege.” White people, we are told, are given such preferential treatment in our society that these benefits and opportunities must be offered to non-whites and withheld from whites in order to level the playing field. This preferential treatment is difficult to detect, of course. By all appearances, it is exactly the reverse: it seems that every group except whites has some society, organization, or association dedicated to their advancement, but pay no mind to such petty details, we are told. White privilege is invisible, but it must exist, for without it there is no explanation for the racial gaps in achievement, wealth, intelligence, and crime rates - except, that is, for the genetic explanation.</p>
<p>The concept of “white privilege” is nonsense. Contrary to popular belief, the vast majority of whites receive no inheritance whatsoever​ <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.2139/ssrn.2665627">[13]</a>​. Whites are more likely than other groups to work their way through college​ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016034237/https://www.childtrends.org/indicators/youth-employment">[14]</a>​. Compared to whites, a greater percentage of black and hispanic students receive grants, loans, and scholarships, often based solely on their race​ <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3707607551737437980&hl=en">[15]</a>​. There is no evidence of employer discrimination against blacks and hispanics when the employer is aware of the applicant’s criminal background​ <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.2139/ssrn.2795795">[16]</a>​. There is no disparity in criminal sentencing between whites and nonwhites when controlling for courtroom behavior and the severity of the crime​ <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.paid.2013.01.020">[17]</a>. Police are less likely to fire upon a black suspect in any given situation than they are to fire upon a white suspect​ <a href="https://copinthehood.com/killed-by-police-2-of-3-race-2/">[18]</a>​. In fact, when they are equipped with a body camera, police become more likely, not less, to use force against black suspects because a camera protects them from false accusations of racial discrimination​ <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.2139/ssrn.2808662">[19]</a>.</p>
<p>There is no white privilege. The idea is simply an after-the-fact justification for whites being treated as second-class citizens in our own nations.</p>
<h1>No. 6<br>The Cost of Diversity</h1>
<p>Despite making up just thirteen percent of our population, blacks in the United States commit more than half of all violent crime​20​. Blacks and hispanics account for fifty-four percent of our prison population. One in three black men in the United States will be in prison at some point in his life. Among all acts of violence committed by a member of one race against a member of another race, blacks are the perpetrators eighty-five percent of the time. A black person is twenty-seven times more likely to attack a white person than vice versa. A hispanic is eight times more likely to attack a white person than vice versa. Blacks are six times more likely than whites to commit homicide and twelve times more likely to murder a white person than to be murdered by a white person. The crime gap is largest when it comes to rape: according to the United States Department of Justice, in 2008 there were 19,293 rapes committed by black men against white women; there were zero rapes commited by white men against black women​ <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/cvus08.pdf#page=55">[21]</a>.</p>
<p>None of this is caused by some vague and omnipresent oppression which drives blacks and hispanics to commit crime. None of this caused by racial bias in our justice system. This is simply the inevitable expression of the genetic predispositions of these people.</p>
<p>When it comes to our failing economy, the average black person in the United States carries a lifetime cost of approximately eight hundred thousand dollars; hispanics carry an average lifetime cost of about six hundred thousand dollars. This cost is found by taking the contributions which these people make to our government in the form of tax payments and then comparing that number to the expenses which they incur in the form of government services.</p>
<p>Whites, on the other hand, contribute an average of about two hundred thousand dollars per person over their lifetime​ <a href="http://thealternativehypothesis.org/index.php/2016/05/11/fiscal-impact-of-whites-blacks-and-hispanics/">[22]</a>​. All of this means that in order to balance our nation’s budget, we would need three white people for every hispanic person and four white people for every black person.</p>
<p>Most of us, however, do not want to simply break even. Our people are a family. We want to provide for our young, our elderly, and our sick. We want to feed our hungry, clothe our cold, and house our homeless. We want our children to be educated. None of this will be possible as long as we continue to put the needs of another race, another people, another family above our own. These people are a drain on our resources, and there is no reason to believe that they will ever give more than they have taken. For thousands of years, they have failed to build a functioning society in their own homeland; now, after centuries, with endless encouragement and endless allowances, they have proven themselves incapable of contributing to ours.</p>
<p>Our people are being beaten, raped, and murdered; our coffers are being looted. We accept this because we have been indoctrinated into a cult of diversity, but diversity is not worth the cost. If we do not decide here and now that we have had enough, that we are done being taken advantage of, it will be our children and our grandchildren who pay the steepest price.</p>
<h1>No. 7<br>Positive Segregation</h1>
<p>Segregation has become a dirty word in our society. There is nothing inherently immoral about segregation. People have always lived separate from other people; a house is segregated from the houses around it. Nobody claims that you are oppressing your neighbor because you don’t want him sleeping in your bed. Similarly, when a group of like-minded individuals decides to form a community, they are creating an extended home. Just as one person is not oppressing his neighbor by having walls and a door, a community is not oppressing anyone by having a fence and a gate.</p>
<p>Each society organizes itself in the way that its constituents feel the most at ease. The society created by a group of whites will not resemble the society created by a group of blacks, and neither will resemble the society created by a group of Asians. This is perfectly normal and natural. If the white community wants to place a police officer on every street corner to enforce the law, a black visitor would find that atmosphere oppressive. If the black community wants little or no restriction on personal conduct, a white visitor would find that atmosphere chaotic.</p>
<p>Both groups would be more comfortable in their own respective environments than they would in a compromise of the two. Whites could live happily without the crime that comes with a black population, and blacks could live happily without the oppression that they feel under the white man’s law.</p>
<p>Every person should have the freedom of association to choose with whom they do and do not want to live. It is a fact that members of different races are more comfortable living among their own kind than they are being forced to integrate with others. Segregation goes both ways; just as whites have a right to organize for their own interest and form exclusive homes, communities, and nations, so, too, do blacks. Unfortunately, the only people who are denied this right today are whites. We have no land to call our own. We are not allowed to exclude. We are only excluded.</p>
<p>The purpose of a community is to shelter its members from the dangers of the world. If you can trust your neighbors, a lock on the community gate eliminates the need for a lock on your front door. However, a home is not a home if you do not know or trust the person in the next room, and a community is not a community if you do not know or trust the person in the next house. When we allow anyone and everyone to move into our homes with no regard for our culture or our customs, we lose our sense of community. We stop feeling comfortable letting our children play outside.</p>
<p>We were not meant to live this way; we are a social species. We are designed to live together with our families. Our race is our extended family. It starts with our brothers, sisters, children, and parents; it extends to our aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces, and nephews, and ultimately to our people. A race that loses this family connection will die.</p>
<h1>No. 8<br>Architects of the Modern World</h1>
<p>White Europeans built the modern world. This is not arrogance, it is not ignorance, and it is not eurocentrism. This is merely a statement of fact. In his 2004 book ​Human Accomplishment: The Pursuit of Excellence in the Arts and Sciences, 800 B.C. to 1950​, Charles Murray compiled nearly two hundred encyclopedias from all over the world​ <a href="https://archive.org/details/humanaccomplishm00murr/page/252/">[23]</a>​. His aim was to identify when and where the innovations that changed the world were made. The answer quickly became clear: no matter whether it is a Chinese historian or an Arabic historian telling the story, the conclusion is always the same: virtually all advances in science and technology happened after 1500 A.D. in Europe - more specifically, in Britain, France, Germany, and Italy.</p>
<p>This should not come as a surprise unless you have been thoroughly indoctrinated into the cult of anti-white sentiment that has pervaded our society. Any time the fact is brought up that the world as you know it owes its existence to white Europeans, we are presented with one or two inventions from elsewhere in the world. Some advancements did come from places like China and Southwest Asia, but they were few and far between. Consider the Roman Empire and the ancient Egyptian and Chinese kingdoms: the difference in the level of technology between when those societies began and when they ended is negligible.</p>
<p>Prior to the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution, both of which began in Europe and then spread to the rest of the world, most of humanity lived at subsistence level. In other words, almost every person on the planet lived their entire lives hand-to-mouth, working from sunrise to sunset just to scrape together enough food to survive. Any advancements that you have beyond that level - any free time, any disposable income - is directly because of white Europeans and their innovations. Our agricultural revolution is what allows you to spend your time doing anything other than growing your own food. Our industrial revolution is what gives you access to all of our technology.</p>
<p>Our people are the architects of the modern world. There are those who seek to diminish our accomplishments, whether out of envy or out of hatred. Those people would have you believe that we have stolen credit for their culture’s creations. They would have you believe that any minor advancement made anywhere else on the planet overshadows everything that our people have done. They would have you believe that we looted the rest of the world of its material wealth, and that this is the reason why we have been successful while they have not.</p>
<p>None of this is true.</p>
<p>There is speculation about what exactly it was that made white Europeans after 1500 A.D. so different from everyone who came before. There are theories about seasonal changes in northern Europe, and there are others which focus on the elimination from our genome our most aggressive and violent elements by means of criminal executions. The truth is that it doesn’t matter. What matters is that the modern world will not survive without the people who built it.</p>
<h1>No. 9<br>White Genocide</h1>
<p>Our people are slowly going extinct. In the next thirty years, Europeans are projected to make up only seven percent of the world population​ <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/02/03/10-projections-for-the-global-population-in-2050/#africa">[24]</a>​. White birth rates have fallen below replacement level across the United States. At the same time, birth rates for black and hispanic women are climbing​ <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/80304">[25]</a>​. It is projected that whites will be a minority in the United States and Europe by 2050 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/03/race.world">[26]</a>​. This means that by 2050, there will not be a single country anywhere in the world where white people are in control of our own lives or our own futures, and history shows us what happens when whites live in majority non-white nations.</p>
<p>Robert Mugabe, the former president of Zimbabwe, blamed whites for the impoverished conditions of that nation’s blacks; he passed laws allowing land to be seized from white farmers and redistributed to black Zimbabweans. Whites were brutally beaten and murdered by violent, angry mobs wielding improvised weapons who burned farms to the ground and smeared feces on the walls of white homes​ <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-30/zimbabwes-white-farmers-consider-return-after-land-seizures/10176760">[27]</a>. In South Africa, Andile Mngxitama, member of parliament, publicly called for the mass extermination of whites as recently as 2018: “For every one black person we will kill five white people… We’ll kill their women, we’ll kill their children, we’ll kill anything we find in our way.” This proclamation was met with cheers and applause. Another MP addressed that nation’s whites directly: “Your existence is a crime​ <a href="https://thenewamerican.com/white-genocide-south-african-politician-kill-whites-their-women-and-their-children/">[28]</a>​.” A popular protest song in South Africa is called “Shoot the Boer,” referring to white South Africans of Dutch descent.</p>
<p>The marginalization of whites in our own nations is not an accident. Powerful media and business groups are actively discouraging whites from reproducing. “Should we be having fewer children for the sake of the planet?” asks the Guardian​ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2017/oct/07/should-we-be-having-fewer-children-for-the-sake-of-the-planet">[29]</a>​. “Environmentalists know how many kids you have - too many,” writes Timothy Benson for National Review​ <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/09/environmentalists-preach-have-fewer-kids/">[30]</a>. “Having a child, especially for the world’s wealthy, is one of the worst things you can do for the environment,” writes Travis Rieder for NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/science-proves-kids-are-bad-earth-morality-suggests-we-stop-ncna820781">[31]</a>​. Of course, these articles are only ever directed at whites.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, these same groups are encouraging mass immigration into our nations from third world countries despite the fact that those people have, on average, far more children than we do.</p>
<p>This is not a conspiracy theory; they will tell you this to your face. “The white race is the cancer of human history,” writes Susan Sontag, former president of PEN America​ <a href="http://www.bu.edu/partisanreview/books/PR1967V34N1/HTML/files/assets/basic-html/index.html#58">[32]</a>​. “It is the white race and it alone - its ideologies and inventions - which eradicates autonomous civilizations wherever it spreads, which has upset the ecological balance of the planet, which now threatens the very existence of life itself.” “Make no mistake about it,” writes Harvard professor Noel Ignatiev​ <a href="https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781556525186/page/298/mode/1up">[33]</a>. “We intend to keep bashing the dead white males, and the live ones, and the females too, until the social construct known as ‘the white race’ is destroyed - not ‘deconstructed’ but destroyed.” “All I want for Christmas is white genocide,” writes Drexel University professor George Ciccariello-Maher​ <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/28/us/drexel-university-professor-resigns/index.html">[34]</a>. There is no question that this is happening.</p>
<p>The only question is what to do about it.</p>
<h1>No. 10<br>An Indifferent Leadership</h1>
<p>While our lands, our rights, and our history are being stripped from us, the people to whom we have entrusted our safety have failed to protect us. Our elected representatives no longer have our interests at heart. The Chancellor of Germany is not concerned with the welfare of the German people, she is concerned with the welfare of third world refugees and economic migrants. The Prime Minister of Great Britain is not concerned with the welfare of the British people, she is concerned with international business interests. The President of the United States is not concerned with the welfare of the American people, he is concerned with advancing the globalist cause.</p>
<p>In the European Union, German Chancellor Angela Merkel unilaterally decided to allow hundreds of thousands of fighting age middle-eastern men to flood into her country. "As far as an upper limit [on refugees] is concerned, my position is clear: I will not accept it," says Merkel​ <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/17/europe/germany-refugees-merkel/index.html">[35]</a>.</p>
<p>The result of her decision has been skyrocketing rates of rape and murder throughout the country​ <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-01-03/germany-must-come-to-terms-with-refugee-crime">[36]</a>​ and a crashing economy as these migrants are content to feed off of Germany’s welfare state without looking for work or looking to contribute​ <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/01/31/germany-majority-refugees-still-jobless/">[37]</a>​. Sweden, with its self-proclaimed “feminist” government, has fared even worse; it is now known as the “rape capital of Europe​ <a href="https://wjla.com/news/inside-your-world/crime-stats-show-increase-in-violence-against-women-in-sweden-after-refugee-crisis">[38]</a>​.” By placing the needs of a foreign race, a race which destroyed their own homeland and their own nations with their violence and their brutality, above that of their fellow Europeans, the governments of Europe have condemned the very people they were meant to protect.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, the British people held a referendum in 2016 in which they voted, as a nation, to leave the European Union. This decision was inspired at least in part by Merkel’s refugee policy; the British did not want to suffer the same fate as the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>However, Britain’s elected officials have steadfastly refused to honor the results of the referendum. Three years later, the United Kingdom is still a part of the European Union, and Prime Minister Theresa May is now considering holding a second referendum​ <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-hammond/uk-parliament-very-likely-to-consider-new-brexit-referendum-hammond-idUSKCN1RO1EG">[39]</a>​. The British people will continue to vote until they get the correct result, it seems.</p>
<p>In the United States, no matter whether we elect a Democrat or a Republican, the result is always the same. Both President Obama and President Trump swore to end interventionist wars in the Middle East; both promised stricter border control and a crackdown on illegal immigration. Neither delivered. The highest office in the land is either unable or unwilling to fulfill the will of the people. As soon as a candidate takes office, they drop whatever platform on which they were elected and continue the work of their predecessor with barely an interruption.</p>
<p>Voting does not work; the powers that be simply ignore us, betray us, and abandon us.</p>
<p>Our society is speeding toward a cliff with a brick on the accelerator and there is nobody at the wheel. No one person has the power to make a meaningful change. We are ruled by an army of cowards whose only aim is reelection. Democracy has failed.</p>
<h1>No. 11<br>A Loss of Freedom</h1>
<p>For several years now, our rights have been slowly diminished by large corporations with too much power over our lives. No longer are we allowed freedom of speech in any meaningful capacity; individuals holding the “wrong” opinions are unpersoned, their presence scrubbed from the Internet, their bank accounts shut down, and their names made unspeakable. In 2017, Visa, Discover, and others stated their intent to ensure that their services could not be used by those who subscribe to ideologies which they have labelled “hateful​ <a href="https://fortune.com/2017/08/18/visa-paypal-mastercard-hate-groups-charlottesville/">[40]</a>.” Web services such as Gab, an alternative to Twitter which was committed to freedom of speech, have been terminated by these companies for engaging in “hate speech​ <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gab-temporarily-shuts-down-after-godaddy-pulls-support-2018-10">[41]</a>.” Apple has disabled Apple Pay support for websites which sell clothing carrying white pride logos​ <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/apple-removes-payments-support-from-white-nationalist">[42]</a>​. Even PayPal has begun deactivating the accounts of those who have been accused of “racism​ <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paypal-suspends-dozens-of-racist-groups-sites-altright-com/">[43]</a>​.” These companies have chosen to take an active hand in policing what thoughts and opinions we are allowed to have, and their support always goes in one direction. We are told that “racism” is unacceptable; any white person who expresses pride in their race is labelled a “supremacist” and ousted from the public dialogue. Meanwhile, every other racial group is encouraged to take pride in theirs. We are told that censorship is necessary to prevent “hate crimes,” “terrorism,” or “racial violence” on the part of radical whites. Meanwhile, accounts actively encouraging Islamic jihad against the West remain online. As an experiment, users have posted identical statements from multiple accounts espousing racially motivated hatred; in one instance, they post as a white user expressing hatred of blacks, and in the other, as a black user expressing hatred of whites. In every case, the white account is banned and blocked while the black account is found not to have violated the terms of service.</p>
<p>It is clear what is happening: these companies are taking sides in the racial conflict.</p>
<p>Whites are the only people that are being purged from polite society. Whites are the only people that are having their bank accounts revoked. Whites are the only people who are being accused of “hate” and of “racism.” Soon, these companies will have succeeded in expunging all wrongthink from the Internet. We will be unable to speak to each other or to anyone else because we will be banned from all social media. We will be unable to create or fund our own businesses because banks and payment processors will refuse to deal with us. We will be unable to support our families as we are fired from our jobs for expressing the wrong ideas, and as the final insult, we will be unaware of this process as it happens because we will only see that news which these companies want us to see. We will be blind and deaf to our own oppression.</p>
<p>These people want to see us destitute and homeless on the street and they want us to be voiceless in our own societies; they are getting what they want. We are allowing this to happen because they are private companies and we are unwilling to police their behavior, but now they have begun policing ours. We can no longer afford to stand idly by while we are enslaved.</p>
<h1>No. 12<br>A Dishonest Press</h1>
<p>As our politicians and corporations have become increasingly despotic, the fourth estate, intended to be a champion of the common people, has abandoned its duty to the truth. News organizations are now explicitly political; what’s worse, they are entirely owned by individuals and corporations with a vested interest in controlling the narrative that reaches our ears. We are bombarded twenty-four hours a day from all angles with what amounts to little more than propaganda.</p>
<p>When the founding fathers of the United States of America included the freedom of the press in the Bill of Rights, they knew that an informed populace was important to any functioning society and essential in a democracy. According to Benjamin Franklin, “Republics and limited monarchies derive their strength and vigor from a popular examination into the action of the magistrates <a href="https://www.charleskochinstitute.org/issue-areas/free-speech-and-peace/importance-of-a-free-press/">[44]</a>.” When the press renounce their objectivity and become political partisans, however, they are no longer performing their intended function; instead, they become instruments of the very power they were meant to check.</p>
<p>Today, the power of the press has been thoroughly debased and twisted against its original purpose. Every major news organization in the United States is owned and operated by a handful of the wealthy elite. Ninety percent of our mass media is owned by just six companies: General Electric, News Corporation, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, and CBS​ <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6">[45]</a>. Their subsidiaries include every media organization you could name: the ​Wall Street Journal​, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and many, many more. When it comes to reporting the news, each and every one of those subsidiaries has one goal: to improve their parent company’s bottom line. Rather than honestly and dispassionately reporting the news, our press is simply another business venture of the same people whom they are supposed to be investigating.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the lines between these companies and our government have become more and more blurred. In 2018 alone, General Electric spent $8,827,817 on lobbyists and in political donations. News Corporation spent $4,960,795, Disney spent $9,352,497, and Time Warner spent $5,493,026​ [46]​. Our news media are not holding the powerful to account; they are the powerful. They are not monitoring the wealthy elite for abuses of the people; they are the wealthy elite. Increasingly, they are not investigating, interrogating, or observing our government; they are our government.</p>
<p>As Thomas Jefferson said, “I have looked on our present state of liberty as a short-lived possession unless the mass of the people could be informed to a certain degree​ <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/99-01-02-0958">[47]</a>.” In our nations today, the people are no longer informed. Our media organizations seek not to uncover the truth but to bury it; they seek not to enlighten us but to deceive us. There is not a single major news outlet in any of our nations that honestly reports the truth. Instead, they lie, dissemble, and equivocate. A dishonest press is the enemy of the people.</p>
<h1>No. 13<br>The Jewish Question</h1>
<p>The Jewish people have always functioned as a nation within a nation - that is, they have formed close-knit groups within other people’s lands and worked for the benefit of their own coethnics at the expense of the host society. Nowhere is this more evident than in the United States today; there is no racial, ethnic, or religious group more committed to the oppression and persecution of whites than the Jews.</p>
<p>In a 2009 poll, the general public opposed by a margin of nineteen percent the practice of affirmative action, that is, programs which give preference to blacks and other minorities in hiring, promotions, and college admissions. The Jews, however, supported such policies by a margin of four percent. When asked if such programs should be continued even if they resulted in fewer opportunities for whites, the general public’s support for them dropped, opposing the programs by a margin of thirty percent. When the question was framed in that way, however, Jews supported the programs by a margin of nine percent. When the programs were framed as explicitly harmful to whites, Jewish support for them increased​ <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/Poll-Release-Legacy?releaseid=1307">[48]</a>​.</p>
<p>Jews are heavily overrepresented in our higher education system. Despite making up less than three percent of the U.S. population, there are more Jews than whites at many of our Ivy League universities. In fact, when taking into account various measures of merit, such as IQ and test scores, there are more than three times as many Jews in our universities as there would be if admissions were based on merit alone. The number of whites attending our higher education institutions is only about a third of what it should be in a strictly meritorious system. This imbalance in admissions between Jewish and white students could be explained by the fact that Jews are similarly overrepresented among the faculty of these institutions​ <a href="https://archive.org/details/scientificeliten0000zuck/page/71/">[49]</a>.</p>
<p>Nearly half of the American media is composed of Jewish people; every major American news organization is owned and operated by Jews​ <a href="https://archive.org/details/mediaelite00lich/page/22/">[50]</a>. There are thirteen Israeli dual citizens in the United States Senate and twenty-seven in the House of Representatives <a href="https://archive.jewishcurrents.org/the-112th-congress/">[51]</a>​; since 1949, Jewish lobbyists and politicians have secured more than $134 billion in foreign aid from the American government for Israel​ <a href="https://ifamericansknew.org/stat/cost.html">[52]</a>​. Jews account for eighty percent of political donations to the Democratic National Committee and twenty-five percent of political donations to the Republican National Committee​ <a href="https://rudermanfoundation.org/white_papers/the-jewish-vote%E2%80%A8political-power-and-identity-in-us-elections/">[53]</a>​. In 2019, while Congress was deadlocked on every other issue, the House of Representatives voted four hundred twenty four to zero to condemn anti-Semitism. Not one person in our government dissented​ <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2019/02/13/house-votes-to-take-stand-against-anti-semitism-in-an-unexpected-way/">[54]</a>​. Before 1970, no American soldier had ever died fighting the enemies of Israel; since 1970, almost no American soldier has died fighting anyone else.</p>
<p>We have a Jewish elite in our nation with views that are ideologically opposed to the general American public. If you have a problem with how our government operates, if you have a problem with how our corporations operate, or if you have a problem with how our media operates, you have a problem with Jews.</p>
<h1>No. 14<br>The Fourteen Words</h1>
<p>We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.</p>
<p>These fourteen words are simple, they are true, and yet they are controversial. Reuters calls this statement “a white supremacist mantra.” Vice News calls it “a white supremacist slogan.” Other outlets have described it as “a racist rallying cry,” an “infamous racist mantra,” and “the heart of the white supremacist credo.” Patreon has banned users for saying these words: “You recently sincerely recited the Fourteen Words... We do not support exclusionary ideologies​ <a href="https://www.theunshackled.net/philosophy/alt-right/faith-goldy-banned-from-patreon/">[55]</a>​.” The phrase “white supremacy” refers to a belief that white people are inherently superior to people of other races; however, this definition is vague. A white person is not better than a black person in the same sense that a dog is not better than a cat. The statement makes no sense; it’s a matter of opinion. When we speak of white nationalism or white separatism, we are speaking not of superiority but of difference. The inherent physical and psychological differences among the races guarantee that any given member of a race will be more comfortable living among their own kind than living among others. A white nation will naturally create the society that is most agreeable to the sensibilities of white people; this does not mean that white people are “better” than other people. Do not infer a value judgment from a statement of fact.</p>
<p>Ethnic nationalism is universally accepted for every race in the world except whites.</p>
<p>Black African nations have routinely expelled whites from within their borders, as is their right.</p>
<p>East Asian nations have done the same. Africa is for the Africans; Asia is for the Asians. Nobody disputes this, and any time whites have attempted to move into another race’s land in the same way that they have moved into ours, we are confronted with shrieks of “colonialism.” The very same people who would deny whites the right to a racially exclusive society will fight tooth and nail to keep us out of others’ lands.</p>
<p>White nationalism seeks only to establish a permanent homeland for the white race; this homeland would be under the control of whites and would exist for the sole purpose of securing the existence of our people and a future for white children. We would not be oppressing anybody by doing this; in fact, for many this should be exactly what they want. It has become clear that whites are reviled by many of the people with whom we have been forced to cohabitate. They should be glad to see us go. There are only two reasons why anyone would deny us the right to part ways with the other races: either to see us enslaved or to see us exterminated.</p>
<p>The modern world will not survive without the white race, and the white race will not survive a multicultural society. White nationalism is the one and only path forward for our people. We must separate and we must segregate. Otherwise, “at least we weren’t racist” will be the epitaph on a mass grave of billions as the progress that we have made regresses until this planet can no longer sustain its population.</p>
<h1>No. 15<br>What Comes Next</h1>
<p>George Orwell once said that “the most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history.” For eighty years, whites have been the victims of a slow but steady cultural erasure. We have been told that our people have never contributed anything of value to the world and that we have stolen credit for all of our achievements. We have been told that our ancestors were the perpetrators of every evil throughout history. We have been told that our conceptions of race are figments of our imaginations and that those whom we perceive to be our people and our family are in fact no more closely related to us than the average black African. We have been told that the violence committed against our people at the hands of immigrants from the third world is our own fault.</p>
<p>We have been told that we must pay for the welfare and comfort of other races while our own people slowly die. We have been told that we are the beneficiaries of an invisible privilege and that for this we should feel guilty and ashamed.</p>
<p>I refuse to accept this narrative. I choose the truth.</p>
<p>A convergence of government, corporate, and media interests has conspired to impress this narrative upon you and your children for the express purpose of controlling you and preventing you from banding together with your people for the betterment of your race. These people want us weak, they want us blind, they want us ignorant, and they want us enslaved. They want us working not toward a better future for our people but toward a better future for theirs. A parasitic element within our governments drives us toward endless war; our soldiers are dying thousands of miles from home and we are reaping absolutely no benefit from any of this. Our resources and our labor are spent on welfare for people with no interest in integrating into our society or contributing to our progress. Corporations run by outsiders strip us of our ability to communicate and our ability to organize while giving us just enough bread and circuses to make us complacent and compliant.</p>
<p>We have been misled into believing that there is nothing we can do. Threats of violence keep us cowed, but those threats are empty. The same soldiers and police officers on which our governments would rely to control us are our own brothers and sisters. Never forget that our leaders derive their power from the people. They have only as much power over us as we allow them and no more. We do not have to bow down to our oppressors. We have nothing to fear.</p>
<p>The best defense against tyranny is an armed and informed populace. I cannot arm you, but I have informed you. Now I call on you to do your part. Send this message to everyone you know. Post it on every form of social media to which you have access. Print copies and leave them at your work, at your school, at the library, in the waiting room at your dentist. Hand them out to your friends and family.</p>
