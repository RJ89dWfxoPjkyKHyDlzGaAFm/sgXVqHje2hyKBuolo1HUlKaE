<p>According to Global Wealth Report 2021 <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/global-wealth-report.html">1</a>, all the wealth on Earth adds up to $418.3 trillion. If we distributed the wealth evenly, each adult would have $79,952. If your net worth is higher than $79,952, you are oppressing someone else. "Tax the Rich" means taxing anyone whose net worth is higher than $79,952. The combined wealth of millionaires and billionaires is $191.6 trillion. The combined wealth of only billionaires is $8 trillion <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210101033819/https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/">2</a>. Therefore, billionaires own 1.9% (8/418.3) of the world's wealth. Millionaires own 43.8% (183.6/418.3) of the world's wealth. Millionaires own more money than billionaires simply because billionaires are rare and millionaires are very common. There are 56.1 million millionaires worldwide, but only 2,095 billionaires. Also, $1,055,338 qualifies you as being the wealthiest one percent. $5 million qualifies you as being the wealthiest 0.1%. And 50% of humans have less than $7,552. If you want socialism: millionaires, billionaires, and hundred-thousandaires, should not exist.</p>

<p>The limitations of the Global Wealth Report is it only measures household wealth of adults, which means it does not include wealth owned by our governments. If you want to see which governments own the most money, check out this wikipedia page titled "List of countries by government budget."</p>
