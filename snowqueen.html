<p>This only cool part of this story is the intro. The intro is about a demon who invented a magical mirror. The demon, he just likes to go around and play pranks on God's angels. But the best prank he ever did was when he invented the magic mirror. The magic mirror has a special property so that anyone who looks at it their world-view changes. The mirror makes everything turn hideous and ugly. It is said that the mirror makes you view life the way the Devil interprets.</p>
