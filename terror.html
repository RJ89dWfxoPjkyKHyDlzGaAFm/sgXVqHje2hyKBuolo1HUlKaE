<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Readers of my website. Something big happened to me. A terrorist attack was reported on the news, and the suspect was never found. But I know <b>exactly</b> who did it. I feel like posting all their information onto my website. But I think the right thing to do is report it to the police. But I'm not sure if can trust the police or FBI; about evidence tampering, because this criminal is rich, and powerful, and highly intelligent. He has connections everywhere. I just don't know what to do. I'm serious. This is big.</p>

<p>I'll keep you guys updated...</p>

<p>Two words: Zionist Mafia.</p>
<p>This story that I am trying to expose is so huge. Multiple criminals involved. I know where one of them lives. I feel like posting his home address. But I know that is illegal. But this person is so evil. I will just say it. I think he is a pedophile, but I don't have any real proof. When I break this story. My life will be in danger. That is why I feel like changing the name of my website, to protect myself. But if I change the name, how will my readers find me again?</p>

<p>Hopefully, this story will be ready before Halloween.</p>

<p>This story is so huge. I stopped everything I am doing to work on this investigation. I am not working for the police or FBI. Because the law enforcement will think I am crazy if I start telling them about "the Zionist Mafia is trying to kill me." My readers, I know you think I am larping. So I will give you a hint. This story is about criminals on Kiwifarms. Go on twitter and type "kiwifarms" and you will find hundreds of stories about organized criminals. I wish I could share more information...</p>
