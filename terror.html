<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Readers of my website. Something big happened to me. There was a terrorist attack which was reported on the news, and the suspect was never found. But I know <b>exactly</b> who did it. I feel like posting all their information onto my website. But I think the right thing to do is report it to the police. But I'm not sure if can trust the police or FBI; about evidence tampering, because this criminal is rich, and powerful, and highly intelligent. He has connections everywhere. I just don't know what to do. I'm serious. This is big.</p>

<p>I'll keep you guys updated...</p>
