<p>James Bronson wrote a fictional short story titled "It's a Wonderful Race, After All <a aria-hidden="true" href="http://www.seanbryson.com/articles_on_sean_bryson_website/wonderful_race.html">1</a>." On this page I summarize that story, in my own words for your convenience with major plot spoilers.</p>

<p>Summary: A liberal college student named George is in a verbal political debate about racism with his conservative father. In the end of that debate, George exclaims "Us white people owe reparations to the minorities. Us white people are the oppressors. Humanity would be better off if white people like us never existed." That same night, George fell asleep. George wakes up in a barren North America where suddenly George sees a strange figure upon the sky. George asked "Where am I? Am I dead? What is this place? Are you God?" The spirit replies "No, I am not God. I am God's angel named Clarence. This is Earth if white people never existed. I'll show you around." George asked to see the Native Americans, the Incas, the Africans, the Indians, and the Japanese. George realizes everywhere he goes, without white people there are no comforts of computers, machinery, nor medicine, and so without white people human existence means pain, constant war, and struggle to survive. Because white people never existed, the things white people invented don't exist here. Now just as George is becoming a victim of an old fashioned human sacrifice at the hands of an African tribe, just as a spear is going to puncture George's stomach, George wakes up from this nightmare. George apologizes to his conservative father, and George resents his liberal college professors.</p>
