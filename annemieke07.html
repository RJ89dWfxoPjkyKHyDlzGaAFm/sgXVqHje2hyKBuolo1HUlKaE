<p>This is a prank call I made to an acquaintance named Johnny Arteaga Ramos. We were 14 years old, I used "https://www.prankdial.com/us". This is the specific one I utilized from that website. The reason why it worked is because it waits until you stop talking for it to send the next voice message response.
