<p>This is a prank call I made to an acquaintance named Johann Arteaga Ramos (during High School he preferred to be called Johnny). We were 14 years old, I used "https://www.prankdial.com/us". This is the specific one I utilized from that website. The reason why it worked is because it waits until you stop talking for it to send the next voice message response. Johnny was a theatre student, quite a drama queen. After High School he became a successful photographer and videographer. His website is theWorkofJAR.com. JAR are his initials.
