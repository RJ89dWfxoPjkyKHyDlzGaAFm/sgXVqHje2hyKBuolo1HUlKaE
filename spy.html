<h1>Is Ethan Klein A Foreign Spy?</h1>
<p>Ethan said "Terry Crews is a scab." I googled "What is the meaning of scab in the urban dictionary?" I learned Spongebob Squarepants is the best example of a scab. Everyday, Spongebob is a happy employee who is making Mr. Krabs richer. According to Ethan, if you want to be "woke", you must act like Squidward, who is Mr. Krab's laziest employee. Ethan says <b>Always do the bare minimum</b> at your job.</p>
<p>But yet when it comes to hiring his OWN employees, Ethan said "Only send me your resumes if you have a good work ethic."</p>

<p>This is the scariest advice I ever heard coming from Ethan. Here's why. I read a book titled "Simple Sabotage Field Manual" it teaches you how the USA sent spies into Nazi Germany. To defeat Adolf Hitler, the spies were taught "Get a job in a nazi factory, encourage your fellow factory workers to <b>always do the bare minimum</b>."</p>

<p>It goes into greater detail explaining "Reward your laziest employees, discriminate against your hardest workers, misfile essential documents, tell important callers the boss is busy, etc." And then it literally says "When no one is looking, throw a wrench in the machines, the entire factory will shut down due to repairs, and when your boss asks, <b>just say it was an accident</b>." And then it gets scarier, it says "When no one is looking, burn down the factory, hire fewer janitors, a messy factory burns easier." This is so scary to me, because ever since Russia invaded Ukraine, many factories in the USA are catching on fire. According to snopes.com, we should not worry, because the truth is, all of these fires were <b>started by accidents</b>. STARTED BY ACCIDENTS just like the book says!!!</p>
