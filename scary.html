<p>There’s a homeless man who lives on my street and every morning when the sun rises he blows a trumpet and yells “From Nazareth, Jesus!” And he told me “If I don’t do this ritual, the whole world will be destroyed instantly.” And I just feel scared like what about if he is telling the truth. What about if the only reason I am alive right now is because of this homeless man.</p>
<p>This other homeless man told me “I lived in a beautiful home until Elon Musk stole my patent, promised to reimburse me, but he ignored my phone calls.” This was no ordinary homeless man. He was highly intelligent. He described battery technology using big words. I feel scared like what if he is telling the truth! Elon Musk is known for stealing patents!</p>

<p>But also, what about if Elon Musk has no clue who this homeless man is. And there’s just some delusional homeless man plotting to kill Elon Musk. It could happen to anyone.</p>
<h1>Vanishing Hitchhiker</h1>
<p>My dad told me about this popular Urban Legend.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/gzwJ5_XVDTE">https://youtu.be/gzwJ5_XVDTE</a></p>
<p>This spanish song describes a truck driver who is driving down a long open road and encounters a woman named Jane Doe. Jane Doe said “Can you please drive me to the nearest town? My car broke down.” They are driving together. Finally, the woman said “You see that house. That is my parents’ beautiful ranch. Thank you for bring me here.” Days later, the man returned to the ranch, knocked on the door, and said “Have you seen Jane Doe?” They replied “Jane Doe is my daughter, exactly one year from today, she died in a car accident.”</p>
<p>So basically, this woman died, and her ghost is still out there trying to come home.</p>

<h1>The Licked Hand</h1>
<p>Another popular Urban Legend. A woman who lives alone is cuddling with her dog and watching television at night time. The new reporter said “There is an unhinged man on the loose who just escaped a mental institution.” She falls asleep with her television on. In the middle of the night, she feels scared, so she put her hand to hang off the edge of her bed, and as expected, she feels her dog beginning to lick her hand. It comforts her. But then she looks across the room, and sees her dog standing in front of the television. And she thinks “If my dog is over there, who is licking my hand?”</p>

<h1>The Hook</h1>
<p>Another popular Urban Legend. Two teenagers are cuddling in a car in the middle of nowhere. The radio said “There is an unhinged man with a metal hook for a hand who recently escaped a mental institution.” The man said “Let’s get out of here. This place is creeping me out.” When they get home, they see a bloody hook hanging on the car door handle.</p>

<h1>Edward Bernays</h1>
<p>Ever since the 1800s, German scientists knew tobacco is bad for your health. According to wikipedia, “The German movement was the most powerful anti-smoking movement in the world during the 1930s and early 1940s.” But after world war 2, a jewish man named Edward Bernays single handedly convinced the whole world that tobacco is actually good for your health.</p>

<p>It creeps me out how one person controlled the media and bribed doctors and scientists.</p>
