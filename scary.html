<p>There’s a homeless man who lives on my street and every morning when the sun rises he blows a trumpet and yells “From Nazareth, Jesus!” And he told me “If I don’t do this ritual, the whole world will be destroyed instantly.” He's never missed a day. And I just feel scared like what about if he is telling the truth. What about if the only reason I am alive right now is because of this man. 😱</p>
<p>In Long Beach, CA (2017) this other homeless man told me “My house was foreclosed and now I am homeless because Elon Musk stole my invention/patent.” This was no ordinary homeless man. He was highly intelligent and described batteries using big words. I feel scared like what if he is telling the truth! Elon Musk is known for stealing ideas!</p>

<p>But also, what about if Elon Musk has no clue who this man is. And there’s just a delusional man plotting to kill Elon Musk</p>
<p>But also, Elon Musk said “Even though my car company is named after Nikola <b>Tesla</b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/iPdc7ESJyC4">1</a>, my biggest role model is actually Thomas Edison <a href="https://youtu.be/29CcM9iAA0w?t=47">1</a>.” I've heard from multiple documentaries, that Nikola Tesla was a homeless man, but Thomas Edison stole Nikola Tesla's patent <a href="https://youtu.be/pcrwTN5OEZY?t=111">1</a>, and Nikola Tesla died penniless.</p>
<h1>Vanishing Hitchhiker</h1>
<p>My dad told me about this popular Urban Legend.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/gzwJ5_XVDTE">https://youtu.be/gzwJ5_XVDTE</a></p>
<p>This spanish song describes a truck driver who is driving down a long open road and encounters a woman named Jane Doe. Jane Doe said “My car broke down. Can you please drive me to the nearest town?” They are driving together. Finally, the woman said “You see that distinct ranch over there is where my parents live. Thank you for bring me here.” Days later, the man returned to the ranch, knocked on the door, and said “Have you seen Jane Doe?” They replied “Jane Doe is my daughter, exactly one year from today, she died in a car accident.”</p>
<p>So basically, this woman died, and her ghost is still out there trying to come home.</p>

<h1>The Licked Hand</h1>
<p>Another popular Urban Legend. A woman who lives alone is cuddling with her dog and watching television at night time. The news reporter said “There is a dangerous man on the loose who just escaped a mental institution.” She falls asleep with her television on. In the middle of the night, she feels scared, so she put her hand to hang off the edge of her bed, and as expected, she feels her dog beginning to lick her hand. It comforts her. But then she looks across the room, and sees her dog standing in front of the television. And she thinks “If my dog is over there, who is licking my hand?”</p>

<h1>The Hook</h1>
<p>Another popular Urban Legend. Two teenagers are cuddling in a car in the middle of nowhere at night time. The radio said “There is a dangerous man with a metal hook for a hand who recently escaped a mental institution.” The teenage girl said “No, thank you, I am saving myself for marriage. Please, take me home. This place is creeping me out.” When they get home, they see a bloody hook hanging on the car door handle. If they had stayed a second longer, they would have been killed by the hash slinging slasher!</p>

<p>According to wikipedia, this story is fake, created to stop teenagers from having sex. However, I saw on a documentary that a woman cheated on a man, and over the next few months, this man slowly began to hate women, until finally he went to a place called ‘Lover's Lane’, a secluded area where couples have sex in their cars, and this man hid behind a bush, and as soon as he saw a couple having sex, he grabbed an axe, smashed the car window, and axed both of them to death.</p>
<h1>Edward Bernays</h1>
<p>Ever since the 1800s, German scientists knew tobacco is bad for your health. According to wikipedia, “The German movement was the most powerful anti-smoking movement in the world during the 1930s and early 1940s.” But after world war 2, a jewish man named Edward Bernays single handedly convinced the whole world that tobacco is actually good for your health.</p>

<p>It creeps me out how one person controlled the media and bribed doctors and scientists.</p>
