<p>This woman lives in a lonely apartment, she lives with a dog but noone else. During the night while the woman was bathing in the bathroom, her dog was watching television in the bedroom. The woman was bathing when the television newsperson stated "There is a dangerous man who escaped from a psychiatric institution." the woman walked outside the bathroom wearing an oversized shirt. The dog was now asleep on the sofa chair. The woman remained awake a few minutes before falling asleep too. The woman was asleep on the mattress. Several hours later, the woman was awakened by a noise on the bedroom floor. The woman drowsily picked a chewtoy from the nightstand and placed it on the ground for her dog. The woman's hand was dangling on her bedside. The woman smiled because she felt her dog started tongue licking her hand. The woman brought her hand back. The woman turned her attention towards the television. The woman saw her dog was still there sleeping on the sofa couch. The dog was illuminated from the television. The woman was thinking to herself "That's weird." The woman placed her hand over the mattress edge again. The woman felt something was still tongue licking her hand. The woman was thinking to herself "My dog is asleep on the sofa couch. Who is licking my hand right now?" </p>
