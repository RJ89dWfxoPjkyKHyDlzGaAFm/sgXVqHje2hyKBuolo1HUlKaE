 <p><a href="https://youtu.be/oOoUfGh57sw?t=720">Ambient Massage Song</a><br>On October 20, 2016, Rhett Mclaughlin published the most amazing one hit wonder titled "Ambient Massage Song." It took the world by storm like the plot of Party Rock Anthem by LMFAO, or the plot of Monty Python's Funniest Joke in the World. Rhett's song caused a zombie apocalypse. If you are reading this, it means I am already dead. We took humanity for granted...</p> 
 
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLSAs5l9CuI">Elliot Smith - Between the Bars</a><br>The lyrics personifies addiction. The lyrics "Drink up baby" is referring to the predatory rhetoric of alcoholism upon victims, enticing users to drink by the promise of pleasant possibilities. "Between the Bars" refers to the hours of sobriety. Elliott Smith was eerily stabbed to death possibly from suicide or homicide. This song was referenced in a Rick and Morty <a href="https://youtu.be/rhHMFA8LMDo">episode</a>.</p><hr>
  
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/B1QnC7RVJyw?t=4">Burgmuller - The Farewell, Op. 100 No. 12</a><br>Le Adieu describes the pain of losing someone due to death or circumstances. The intro: starts off very slow (immobility). The verse: notes are close together (frustration). The chorus suddenly becomes feliz (bipolarism). The outro ended on a bitter note. The next piece, Op. 100 No. 13 is titled Consolation.</p>
 
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/B1QnC7RVJyw?t=4">CUCO - Omar Banos</a><br>I went to the same High School as Omar Banos. Me and Omar had bandclass together with Mr. Hughes. During the first week of school, Mr. Hughes told the bandclass "I never went to High School. During my High School years, all I did was smoke weed and ditch school to have sex with my girlfriend while my parents were at work. I turned out alright.</p>
<p>"Brain Wilson sat in this very same bandroom some years ago. He was not much different each of you. This classroom is the oldest building on campus, that is why all other classrooms are made of drywall, but this one is made of bricks. Nobody is allowed to hangout near this building during lunch period because, some years ago a security guard discovered marching band students were having sex there. The teacher sent Brian Wilson outside because he didn't do his homework, which was to write a simple rhyming lyrics. Brian Wilson went outside, finished his homework, returning the teacher a curious paper with the perplexing title Surfin' USA. The teacher said to Brian Wilson "You are a failure." That's right folks. Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys wrote Surfin' USA right there on that pavement. It is a true story because Surfin' USA was a simple rip off of Sweet Little Sixteen by Chuck Berry, which by the way, Chuck Berry was a pervert who installed cameras inside womens' bathrooms. Sweet Little Sixteen was a song about the age of consent. Chuck Berry also wrote a creepy song called My Ding A Ling." 
 
One day a janitor knocked upon the bandroom while Mr. Hughes was conducting. The janitor peered through the door, he acknowledged Mr. Hughes, he acknowledged the students. The janitor left. Mr. Hughes said "Somebody check if the janitor left. Take this bathroom pass. FUCK. Bandclass is over. I'm mad at the janitor, for not cleaning this classroom in months. All he does is walk in while I am teaching and pretend like he doesn't know my schedule. He has been complaining about back pain. FUCK. He is going to sue the school, and he is going to win because he is... black."
