<p><a href="Between-the-Bars-Lyrics.html">These</a> are the lyrics. The lyrics personifies addiction. The lyrics "Drink up baby" is referring to the predatory rhetoric of alcoholism upon victims, enticing users to drink by the promise of pleasant possibilities. "Between the Bars" refers to the hours of sobriety. Elliott Smith was eerily stabbed to death possibly from suicide or homicide. This song was referenced in a Rick and Morty <a href="https://youtu.be/rhHMFA8LMDo">episode</a>.</p><hr>
  
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/B1QnC7RVJyw?t=4">Burgmuller - The Farewell, Op. 100 No. 12</a></p>
<p>Mozart and Beethoven wrote hours long composition that was mostly shit. Friedrich Burgmuller's went straight to the point because all his compositions are amazing but shorter than 1.5 minutes. The most remarkable quality is that he followed a verse-chorus-verse form, so he basically started rock and roll music, and pop music. Le Adieu is a song that describes the pain of losing someone to death or circumstances. The intro: starts off very slow, sad, bitter, but resolute. The verse: notes are close together in a frustrated manner. The chorus suddenly is very happy which symbolizes bipolarism. The contrast between the verse and chorus, is a battle between happiness and sadness. The outro ends on a bitter note. The next piece, Op. 100 No. 13 is titled Consolation.</p>
