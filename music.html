 <p><a href="https://youtu.be/oOoUfGh57sw?t=720">Ambient Massage Song</a><br>On October 20, 2016, Rhett Mclaughlin published the most amazing one hit wonder titled "Ambient Massage Song." It took the world by storm like the plot of Party Rock Anthem by LMFAO, or the plot of Monty Python's Funniest Joke in the World. Rhett's song caused a zombie apocalypse. If you are reading this, it means I am already dead. We took humanity for granted...</p> 
 
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLSAs5l9CuI">Elliot Smith - Between the Bars</a><br>The lyrics personifies addiction. The lyrics "Drink up baby" is referring to the predatory rhetoric of alcoholism upon victims, enticing users to drink by the promise of pleasant possibilities. "Between the Bars" refers to the hours of sobriety. Elliott Smith was eerily stabbed to death possibly from suicide or homicide. This song was referenced in a Rick and Morty <a href="https://youtu.be/rhHMFA8LMDo">episode</a>.</p><hr>
  
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/B1QnC7RVJyw?t=4">Burgmuller - The Farewell, Op. 100 No. 12</a><br>Le Adieu describes the pain of losing someone to death or circumstances. The intro: starts off very slow, sad, bitter, but resolute. The verse: notes are close together in a frustrated manner. The chorus suddenly is very happy which symbolizes bipolarism. The contrast between the verse and chorus, is a battle between happiness and sadness. The outro ends on a bitter note. The next piece, Op. 100 No. 13 is titled Consolation.</p>
 
 <p><a href="https://youtu.be/B1QnC7RVJyw?t=4">CUCO - Omar Banos</a><br>I went to the same High School as Omar Banos. Me and Omar had bandclass together with Mr. Hughes. One day Mr. Hughes told us "Do you know Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys? I was not Brain Wilson's music teacher, however the consensus has been that Brian Wilson sat in this very room some years ago. This very classroom is the oldest building on campus, that is why all other classrooms are made of drywall, but this one is made of bricks. The reason why nobody is allowed to hangout near this building during lunch period is because, some years ago a security guard discovered two students having sex behind there and ever since noone is allowed to congregrate there anymore. These High Schoolers looked for every nook and cranny to try to have sex in, eventually they found one. The homework assignment was the students to write an original music composition. Brian Wilson didn't do his homework. The teacher reprimanded him and told Brian Wilson to stand outside to complete his assignment. Brian Wilson went outside, but returned a paper with lyrics on it. It was the lyrics to Surfin' USA. The music teacher said 'Your music is shit. You won't amount to anything. Sit down.' Years later, his lyrics became a famous song. That's right folks. Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys wrote the lyrics of Surfin USA right there on the pavement. And it was probably a true story because Surfin USA is a simple rip off of Sweet Little Sixteen by Chuck Berry, which by the way.
