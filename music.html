<p style="display:none;">This girl wrote the saddest song ever "I want to fall into the floor, I am doing dances in my own head." It means she is toying with the idea about killing herself. She wants to be buried in a coffin. She wrote another song "I want to die" <a href="https://youtu.be/2DYmhyytfMw?t=617">1</a>. This bitch is literally talking about killing herself and all the comments are like "Wow you look beautiful üòç"</p>

<p>"Between the Bars" by Elliott Smith is a genius song. At first glance, it seems like a break-up song. But if you analyze the lyrics, it describes a man who is holding a bottle of vodka, and suddenly the bottle comes alive, grows arms, eyes, legs, and a mouth. The bottle said "Drink me, go on and kiss me, one sip is all you need, I will make your dreams come true. Every mistake you ever made, every painful memory that replays in your head, I make it all go away." The man said "My friends tell me I need rehab and therapy." The bottle replied "Your friends are a bunch of greedy, lying, hypocrites. Stay away from them. They want to ruin your life because they are jealous of our greatness." The man drinks a glass, and suddenly the bottle turns evil and says "Yes, I have you right where I want you. Lonely, depressed, isolated. Now you are mine forever. Buahahaha! I am a genius. There's a sucker born every minute." Everyone else sees this, except the alcoholic, he's too blacked out drunk.</p>

<p>"Biggest Lie" by Elliott Smith describes a man saying "I am waiting for a train to arrive, so I can jump in front, and die by suicide. The tracks will be covered with my blood, making everyone late for work, as the janitors clean my blood. The value of my life will be reduced to a crushed credit card inside my jean pocket covered with my blood. My credit card says Elliott Smith, but only you know my special nickname, because you are my girlfriend. And when I'm dead, I imagine your face will be white as snow, like you just seen a ghost. I have a love/hate relationship with my girlfriend. I am planning to kill myself because of her." In the end he said "I just told the biggest lie." It means this is a confession but he doesn't want anyone to be concerned, so he says "Don't worry about me, I just told a lie."</p>
