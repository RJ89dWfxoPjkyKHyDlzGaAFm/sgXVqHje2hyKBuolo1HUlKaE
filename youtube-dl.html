<h1>Youtube-dl or Yt-dlp</h1>
<p>Youtube-dl is the best software to download youtube videos, but it is broken right now, like you get extremely slow download speeds. So everyone is using yt-dlp at the moment. However, if you download and extract youtube-dl-master.zip, and execute the following code, it fixes everything. But first you need Python installed.:
python "C:\Users\JovannyR\Downloads\youtube-dl-master\youtube_dl\__main__.py" https://youtu.be/YE7VzlLtp-4

<p>According to security experts <a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/12/up-to-3-million-devices-infected-by-malware-laced-chrome-and-edge-add-ons/">1</a>, one of the most common ways people get malware on their computers is from installing random "Youtube downloaders." Even the Google Play Store and Apple App Store youtube downloaders often contain malware. So just stick to Youtube-dl, yt-dlp, Video DownloadHelper, or any Firefox recommended extensions.</p>
