<h1>End Notes</h1>
<p>JovannyR Comments: By April 2019, this "racist manifesto" was posted anonymously on an imageboard. I disagreed with the overall thesis of The Nationalist.</p>
<p>I think this manifesto is considered free speech because all the information provided is objective and factual. There is no manipulation of the facts. Pretty much, ALL scientists agree that Blacks are violent, and less intelligent. The contention is on the interpretation of the data, and if government policy could improve the blacks. For example, looking at SAT scores of black vs white test takers, rich blacks are smarter than poor blacks, #BlackLives supporters see this as proof that welfare and education improves the blacks. Racists point out that, the poorest whites are still smarter than the richest blacks. H. Monmouth was banned by Twitter because he kept telling people to "Read my manifesto by downloading it here on this obscure website," so he was banned for spamming, but he likes to think that he was banned because there is a Jewish Conspiracy out to get him.</p>
<p>According to JovannyR, my offical verdict is that H Monmouth is a dangerous psychopath who should be on a government watch list for trying to brainwash young impressionable minds, so that he can isolate people in his rapist sexual abuse colony like Colonia Dignidad. That's why 99% of 'white separatists' are white males who want to control womens' reproduction.</p>
