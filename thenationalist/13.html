<h1>No 13 - The Jewish Question</h1> 

<p>The Jewish people have always functioned as a nation within a nation - that is, they have formed close-knit groups within other people’s lands and worked for the benefit of their own coethnics at the expense of the host society. Nowhere is this more evident than in the United States today; there is no racial, ethnic, or religious group more committed to the oppression and persecution of whites than the Jews.</p>

<p>In a 2009 poll, the general public opposed by a margin of nineteen percent the practice of affirmative action, that is, programs which give preference to blacks and other minorities in hiring, promotions, and college admissions. The Jews, however, supported such policies by a margin of four percent. When asked if such programs should be continued even if they resulted in fewer opportunities for whites, the general public’s support for them dropped, opposing the programs by a margin of thirty percent. When the question was framed in that way, however, Jews supported the programs by a margin of nine percent. When the programs were framed as explicitly harmful to whites, Jewish support for them increased <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/Poll-Release-Legacy?releaseid=1307">[48]</a>.</p>

<p>Jews are heavily overrepresented in our higher education system. Despite making up less than three percent of the U.S. population, there are more Jews than whites at many of our Ivy League universities. In fact, when taking into account various measures of merit, such as IQ and test scores, there are more than three times as many Jews in our universities as there would be if admissions were based on merit alone. The number of whites attending our higher education institutions is only about a third of what it should be in a strictly meritorious system. This imbalance in admissions between Jewish and white students could be explained by the fact that Jews are similarly overrepresented among the faculty of these institutions <a href="https://archive.org/details/scientificeliten0000zuck/page/71/">[49]</a>.</p>

<p>Nearly half of the American media is composed of Jewish people; every major American news organization is owned and operated by Jews <a href="https://archive.org/details/mediaelite00lich/page/22/">[50]</a>. There are thirteen Israeli dual citizens in the United States Senate and twenty-seven in the House of Representatives <a href="https://archive.jewishcurrents.org/the-112th-congress/">[51]</a>; since 1949, Jewish lobbyists and politicians have secured more than $134 billion in foreign aid from the American government for Israel <a href="https://ifamericansknew.org/stat/cost.html">[52]</a>. Jews account for eighty percent of political donations to the Democratic National Committee and twenty-five percent of political donations to the Republican National Committee <a href="https://rudermanfoundation.org/white_papers/the-jewish-vote%E2%80%A8political-power-and-identity-in-us-elections/">[53]</a>. In 2019, while Congress was deadlocked on every other issue, the House of Representatives voted four hundred twenty four to zero to condemn anti-Semitism. Not one person in our government dissented <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2019/02/13/house-votes-to-take-stand-against-anti-semitism-in-an-unexpected-way/">[54]</a>. Before 1970, no American soldier had ever died fighting the enemies of Israel; since 1970, almost no American soldier has died fighting anyone else.</p>

<p>We have a Jewish elite in our nation with views that are ideologically opposed to the general American public. If you have a problem with how our government operates, if you have a problem with how our corporations operate, or if you have a problem with how our media operates, you have a problem with Jews.</p>
