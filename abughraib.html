<p>They said "We will make you wish to die and it will not happen." They stripped me naked. One of them told me he would rape me. He drew a picture of a woman to my back and makes me stand in shameful position holding my buttocks. "Do you pray to Allah?" one asked. I said "yes". They said, "Fuck you. And fuck him." One of them said, "You are not getting out of here healthy, you are getting out of here handicapped". And he said to me, "Are you married?" I said, "Yes". They said, "If your wife saw you like this, she will be disappointed." One of them said, "But if I saw her now she would not be disappointed now because I would rape her."</p>
