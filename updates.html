<h1>Gay Incel</h1>
<p>Liberals are so stupid, their minds cannot even comprehend why a gay man would kill other gay men.</p>

<p>Omar Mateen is a gay man who killed gay people, because he was raised in a very strict religious household. His parents hated gays, so Omar hated himself. One day, Omar saw two gay men kissing on the streets and thought to himself "If I kill these faggots, my parents will finally love me, and the lord will love me too."</p>
