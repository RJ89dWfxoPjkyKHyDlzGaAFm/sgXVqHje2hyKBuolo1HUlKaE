<p>OMFG I fucking hate Ethan Klein so much. Ethan Klein reported on his podcast that Elon Musk crashed the stock market for Eli Lilly and Company. I checked on google and it's a fucking lie.</p>

<p>5 days ago.</p>

<p>One month ago.</p>

<p>One year ago.</p>

<p>Eli Lilly and Company got richer. They lost a drop in the bucket. Ethan Klein is evil, greasey, grimey. He makes up lies to defame people. He has no shame.</p>

<p>Every single word that comes out of his mouth is a cleverly disguised lie for malicious intents.</p>

<p>Do you remember when Ethan tweeted something like "As a responsible adult myself, I made the responsible decision to delete a frenemies episode where Trisha Paytas lied about being sexually assaulted by her teacher." It turns out Trisha Paytas was telling the truth. Another victim came forward, and Ethan and his fans all harassed this innocent victim, called her liar, saying "You work for Keemstar". Ethan did all this to make Trisha Paytas seem crazy. All this only because Trisha Paytas is "anti-semitic". There is this subreddit called r/Trishyland, it got banned from reddit.com, because they would talk about killing and raping Trisha Paytas. You will see these crazy ass people who hate Trisha Paytas. Here is just one example. This crazy person made a two hour documentary all about how Trisha Paytas is "anti-semitic". Two fucking hours!!</p>

<p>Anyways, take this with a grain of salt, I am still researching this topic about Trisha vs Ethan.</p>
