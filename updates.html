<p>OMFG I fucking hate Ethan Klein so much. Ethan Klein reported on his podcast that Elon Musk crashed the stock market for Eli Lilly and Company. I checked on google and it's a fucking lie.</p>

<p>5 days ago.</p>

<p>One month ago.</p>

<p>One year ago.</p>

<p>Eli Lilly and Company got richer. They lost a drop in the bucket. Ethan Klein is evil, greasey, grimey. He makes up lies to defame people. He has no shame.</p>

<p>Every single word that comes out of his mouth is a cleverly disguised lie for malicious intents.</p>
