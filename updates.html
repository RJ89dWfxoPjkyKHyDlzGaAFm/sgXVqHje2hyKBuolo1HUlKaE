<p>I saw craig arguing with @WintergreenWolf on Gab.com... Unlocked a new story about @zrcalio.</p>

<p>@zrcalio is a man who dedicated his whole entire life to documenting, reporting, and exposing zoophiles/zoosadists. All day long on twitter, @zrcalio talked about how much he hates zoophiles/zoosadists, he would even report them to the FBI, and then out of nowhere, he got exposed that he is the biggest zoophiles/zoosadists of them all.</p>


<h1>STOP SAYING BASED</h1>
<p>Al-Qaeda means "the foundation" or "the <b>base</b>". Everytime you say "based" it means fundamentalism of Islam.</p>

<h1>Is Craig a serial killer?!?!</h1>
<p>What the fuck is this shit bro dude.</p>

<p>If I were president, the first thing I would do is send Donald Trump to prison, the second thing I would do is end mass incarceration.</p>

<p>I hate gun owners so much. I am thinking about buying a gun and killing every gun owner.</p>
