<p>Due to a boxing match, Ian Washburn got a black eye. No police charges were filed, because Ian consented to it. Ian is happy and smiling.</p>

<h1>If violence is never the answer,</h1>
<p>Should boxing be illegal? Also, some men like to have their balls kicked as a sexual fetish. Should ballbusting be illegal? Football players are hurting themselves. Should football be illegal? Should vaccines be illegal? I don't consent to being stabbed with a needle.</p>

<p>Now imagine if me and my bestfriend got into a verbal argument, and he says to me "Meet me at the park tomorrow at 12:00PM. Bring a gun. Only one man comes out alive." It's called Dueling, the cowboys used to do it. In boxing matches, the fighters consented to it. So why can't me and my bestfriend both consent to kill each other?</p>

<h1>Physical pain is a social construct, according to liberals</h1>
<p>The famous youtuber Tana Mongeau loves to get beat up, slapped around, and choked during sex, she says a man punched her face and her face was bleeding, but she loved it more and it was her most satisfying sexual experience <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/13p_dTc_vzU?t=4377">1</a>. The idea that physical pain should be avoided is not universally accepted as truth. Some subcultures believe pain is desireable.</p>

<h1>Self-Flagellation</h1>
<p><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/fcCA6lGxK_g?t=43">https://youtu.be/fcCA6lGxK_g?t=43</a><br>These people are whipping themselves until their backs bleed, and they say "I whip myself to worship my God."</p>
<p><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/dMQCEnKdpc8">https://youtu.be/dMQCEnKdpc8</a></p>
<p>These other people are cutting themselves for God. Kamikazes kill themselves due to a strong moral code.</p>

<h1>Cannibalism<br>(Armin Meiwes)</h1>
<p>This one dude had cannibalism as a sexual fetish, so he consented to being eaten alive, he died.</p>

<h1>What Would Jesus Do?</h1>
<p>Several men asked "What would Jesus do?" And they said "Well, Jesus got crucified." So they started a tradition where each year several men volunteer to get whipped, tortured, and crucified exactly like Jesus Christ did. Nobody forces them to do it. They do it willfully.</p>

<h1>I volunteer as tribute</h1>
<p>All those Aztecs and Mayans who did human sacrifices, ripped hearts out of living humans. Yeah, it wasn't exactly torture. The "victims" were not forced into it. The victims volunteered to die in the name of God. It was a privilege and honor to die like that.</p>

<h1>Kiss of Judas</h1>
<p>Also, me personally, I have trauma in my life, so I hate it when people hug or kiss me, when someone hugs me, I literally feel physical pain. A hug is like stabbing me in my chest. If you try to hug me, I might punch you. The way I show love to people is by shouting bad words to people like "fuck you stupid ass dumb bitch!" You have to respect my culture. Different cultures perceive pain differently. For some people, a slap is a kiss. In fact, when Rhett and Link were kids, they did a bload oath, they cut their hands with a knife to show their love to each other. Some parents say "I hit my children because I love them."</p>

<p>Also, supposedly the definition of lazy is "strong aversion to pain." And the definition of psychopath is "unusual pain reponse."</p>


<h1>Abortion</h1>
<p>According to liberals, this chart below justifies abortion. The chart says babies can't feel pain even after being born. They say babies start feeling pain only around 8 months AFTER birth.<img src="images\derbyshire2006.webp">Source:<a aria-hidden="true" href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1136/bmj.332.7546.909">1</a>.<br>In 2006, the american scientist Stuart Derbyshire said "Pain experience requires development of mind, and development of the mind occurs <b>outside the womb</b> through the actions of the infant and mutual adjustment with primary caregivers." In other words, physical pain is a social construct. You don't believe me? Check out this video about "The Rubber Hand Illusion."</p>
<p><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/sxwn1w7MJvk?t=7">https://youtu.be/sxwn1w7MJvk?t=7</a></p>
<p>Also, check out "phantom pain" and "nocebo pain."</p>

<p>Pain is only real if you believe it is real. The human skin senses foreign material. Your opinion decides how to feel about foreign materials. Your opinion is based off what society taught you. Society taught you how to feel pain. Pain is a choice.</p>

<h1>Zombie Squid</h1>

<p><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGPfSSUlReM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGPfSSUlReM</a></p>
<p>This video demonstrates why 7 month old babies allegedly do not feel pain. It is a dead squid, but when you add salt, the squid seemingly suffers. But according to american scientists, the squid is not suffering, because the squid is already dead. The squid's limbs moves due to a chemical reaction with the salt. Most scientists agree cockroaches, and venus fly traps, do not feel pain. Due to the scientific principle "nociception", the ability to react does not prove the ability to feel pain. In fact, there are adult humans alive today who can't feel pain called Congenital Insensitivity to Pain. If you bite an apple, the apple responds with a crunchy noise, does that mean apples feel pain? Do plants have emotions? This is a controversial and philosphical debate, used to justify genocides. Like imagine if there are humans alive today, who look like us, talk like us, act like us, but deep down they are soulless.</p>

<h1>Scientific Consensus</h1>
<p>Today in 2022, the scientific consensus in China & Russia says animals can't feel pain. In 2006, the chinese scientist Zhao Nanyuan said "Yet another reason to hate western civilization is they believe animals have emotions." In 2011 <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0109177">1</a>, 63.4% of chinese never even heard of the concept of animals "having rights." Many chinese cheffs are taught "Torture releases adrenaline which contributes to meat's succulent flavor <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/news-features/animal-cruelty-in-china-what-can-be-done-about-it/">1</a>." Meanwhile, many African tribes practice Animism, they believe everything feels pain, including the sky, trees, rivers, and rocks. One white supremacist said "Yet another reason to hate n*ggers is they believe rocks have emotions <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://americansfordevolution.blogspot.com/2012/11/what-blacks-have-never-done.html">1</a>." Below is a video of chinese men laughing while boiling a dog alive. This dog is screaming and crying, and the chinese still believe animals feel no pain.</p>

<p>Here you can see chinese are known for eating fish while the fish is still alive.</p>

<p>Here you can see chinese cutting a shark in half while the shark is still alive.</p>

<p>Also, during the 1970s, the scientific conensus in the USA said black people can't feel, and that is why the U.S. government allowed the Tuskegee Experiments.</p> 


<h1>Pain. Ain't nobody got time for that.</h1>

<p>Pain is like sex. Your body feels horny, but with the right mindset, you can fully control your horniness. Horniness is a choice. Similarly, your body senses pain, but with the right mindset, you can fully block all pain signals. You don't believe me? Check out this video below. A mother was beat up so horrifically, and she said "As I was getting beat up, I wanted to scream, but I forced myself to not scream because I knew if I screamed, my children would scream too, and if my children screamed, my attacker would attack my children <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/appellate-division-unpublished/2018/a5132-15.html">1</a>." Love gives mothers the power to endure pain. Love is heroin. Mothers don't have time to feel pain.</p>

<h1>Manhood Rituals</h1>
<p><p>Joe Rogan takes painful ice baths, just for gun, because it defines his masculinity. Some people say "Getting tattoos is very painful, but I love it, I'm addicted to the pain, it feels great, it gives me power." Some people cut their wrists with a razor and say "It alleviates my depression."</p>

<p>If you are a latino child, following the footsteps of your forefathers, your dream is to one day experience "Blood In, Blood Out" it means you join a gang by getting beat up, because it proves you are an alpha male. If you are an australian native, your dream is to experience "Penile Subincision," it means you cut your own penis in half with an axe, because it proves you are an alpha male. If you are a North American native, your dream is to experience "Sun Dance Ritual," it means you sew rope into your nipples, and you pull the string until your nipples rip out of your chest, because it proves you are an alpha male. These native children are taught "Manhood rituals are voluntary, but if you do not volunteer, God will punish you, and for all eternity you will live a cursed life, you will never get laid, and you will die a virgin <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://youtu.be/7hQEJIaciRM?t=43">1</a>."</p>

<h1>The more pain you can endure, the more awesomer you are.</h1>

<p>Humans arbitrarily decided smiling symbolizes happiness. Similarly, humans arbitrarily decided crying symbolizes pain. But scientifically, crying means nothing. We project our preconceived notions about crying onto babies. But scientifically, babies cannot feel pain until they are taught how to feel pain. If noone teaches children about pain, children will invent their own theories like "pain feels good." That is how children grow up to be criminals. It can happen when the child's cries are ignored, or when a parent shouts at the child's injuries "You stupid dumb b*tch hahaha that's what you get for being a spoiled brat!" When the child enters school, the teacher says "Pain is bad for society." The child must decide whether to believe his teacher or believe his parents or believe his own personal theories. Whatever the child chooses to believe about pain it will become his personal reality. If he chooses to believe "pain feels good" his worldview begins on that assumption. He builds more assumptions based on the previous assumptions. Eventually, he is so deep down the rabbit hole of believing "pain feels good" that he will ignore all evidence indicating "pain feels bad."</p>


<p>So that's why I support women's rights to abortion. We should legalize killing babies AFTER they are born, because the science says babies can't feel pain until around 8 months AFTER birth.</p>

<p>To be honest, I don't actually believe in any of this bullsh*t nonsense. I just wrote this page because I hate it when liberals say "Race and gender is a social contruct." I'm like "B*tch f*ck you <b>pain is a social construct.</b>"</p>

<p>So I did research, and it turns out, "pain is a social construct" is actually what liberals believe. The science literally says babies can't feel pain. So I'm like "fuck it trust the scientists".</p>
