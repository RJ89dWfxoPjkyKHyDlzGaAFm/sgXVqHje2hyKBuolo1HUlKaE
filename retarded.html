<h1>I Was Literally Mentally Retarded</h1>
<p>The first symptom is that I was potty trained very late. When I was 5 years old, I was literally pooping my underwear every single day. I used to hide behind window curtains to poop myself. Then, when an adult discovered I was soiled, I didn't allow anyone to remove the feces from my underwear. I ran away and cried very loudly in tantrums. If anyone touched me, I punched them. My uncles held me down forcefully to wash me.</p>
<p>"Why didn't I react like this?" Now that I am wiser, I am trying to understand my younger self. Here are my explanations. One, I was terrified at the thought of my own butthole. Two, I was terrified at the thought of someone seeing my butthole. Three, I was terrified at the thought of pooping in foreign bathrooms; during my toilet training, there was not a permanent toilet for me to go, since my mother always worked I stayed at other people's houses. Four, I was retarded, I didn't understand the concept of pooping, I thought if I closed my eyes it might cause the poop to vanish or maybe by next morning the poop should go away all on its own.</p>
