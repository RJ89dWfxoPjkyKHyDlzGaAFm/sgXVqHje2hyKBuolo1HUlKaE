<h1>I Was Literally Mentally Retarded</h1>
<p>The first symptom is that I was potty trained very late. When I was 5 years old, I was literally pooping my underwear every single day. I used to hide behind curtains to poop myself. Then, when an adult discovered I was soiled, I didn't allow anyone to remove the feces from my underwear. I ran away and cried very loudly in tantrums. If anyone touched me, I punched them. My uncles held me down forcefully to wash me.</p>
