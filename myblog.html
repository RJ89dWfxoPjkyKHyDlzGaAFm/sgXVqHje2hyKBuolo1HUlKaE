<p>Below is a list of my favorite comedy videos.</p>
<p>The VERY first time I ever witnessed stand-up comedy. I was a little kid watching a Television show titled Fetch!. It was seasons 1 episode 14 "Grandma Ruffman's Recipe for Success." On that episode there was an african-american kid telling jokes to his audience. One day when I was a teenager I realized that somewhere in this world there are grownups doing stand-up comedy. I remembered the joke that was told during the Fetch! episode, the one joke that describes the ridiculousness of stabbing drinking straws through caprisun pouches. That joke could make a kid laugh. I wanted to know what makes grownups laugh. I went tooutube and typed "stand-up comedy." I was skeptical. </p>
