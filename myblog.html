<p>Below is a list of my favorite comedy videos.</p>
<p>The VERY first time I ever witnessed stand-up comedy. I was a little kid watching a Television show titled Fetch!. It was seasons 1 episode 14 "Grandma Ruffman's Recipe for Success." On that episode there was an african-american kid telling jokes to his audience. For some strange reason when I became an adult I remembered the exact joke he told, the one about how difficult it is to stab a drinking straw through a caprison pouch.  </p>
