<p>Below is a list of my favorite comedy videos.</p>
<p>The first time I ever witnessed stand-up comedy. I was a little kid watching a Television show titled Fetch!. It was seasons 1 episode 14 "Grandma Ruffman's Recipe for Success." I was unimpressed.</p>
   
<p>The second time I ever witnessed stand-up comedy. I was a teenager. I went to Youtube and typed "stand-up comedy." On that day I discovered Brian Regan - Something's Wrong with the Regan Boy (1992). This is the greatest and most iconic stand-up comedy performance in my opinion.</p>
   
<p>My second favorite stand-up comedy performance. John Pinette - I Say Nay Nay. The majority of John Pinette's jokes are about food. The eerie fact is that while his audiences laughed at his jokes about food, they were also laughing at the very thing that was slowly and internally murdering John Pinette. John Pinette was aged 50 when he died from Pulmonary Embolism. During 2014 the average lifespan of Americans was 78.9.</p>
   
<p>Other comedians I studied are George Lopez, George Carlin, Felipe Esparza, Micharl Jr., Mike Birbiglia, Gabriel Iglesias, Bill Burr.</p>
