<p>Below is a list of my favorite comedy videos.</p>
<p>The VERY first time I ever witnessed stand-up comedy. I was a little kid watching a Television show titled Fetch!. It was seasons 1 episode 14 "Grandma Ruffman's Recipe for Success."</p>
   
<p>The second time I ever witnessed stand-up comedy. I was a teenager. I went to Youtube and typed "stand-up comedy." On that day I discovered Brian Regan - Something's Wrong with the Regan Boy (1992).</p>
