<p>Below is a list of my favorite comedy videos.</p>
<p>The first time I ever witnessed stand-up comedy. I was a little kid watching a Television show titled Fetch!. It was seasons 1 episode 14 "Grandma Ruffman's Recipe for Success." I was unimpressed.</p>
   
<p>The second time I ever witnessed stand-up comedy. I was a teenager. I went to Youtube and typed "stand-up comedy." On that day I discovered Brian Regan - Something's Wrong with the Regan Boy (1992). This is the greatest and most iconic stand-up comedy performance in my opinion.</p>
   
<p>My second favorite stand-up comedy performance. John Pinette - I Say Nay Nay. 100% all of John Pinette's jokes are about food. John Pinette was aged 50 when he died from Pulmonary Embolism. </p>
