<h1>I Almost Won A Herman Cain Award</h1>
<p>I was laying on a sofa with my head tilted back, coughing, gasping, wheezing, and crying “Mommy! I should have listened! I should have taken the vaccine!” Everyone said “Have you eaten any food?” I replied “I’m starving but I can’t eat food! Every time I eat, I immediately start vomiting.” Everyone said “Take Jovanny to the hospital!” I said “No! I don’t want to go!” After that I just kept my mouth shut. The whole time I was quitely thinking to myself “If they take me to the hospital, the doctor will inject me with poison.”</p>
<h1>Shadow People</h1>
<p>My neighbor told me “Methamphetamine allows me to see <b>shadow people</b>.” He explained there are invisible demons everywhere, causing every disease in the world. So that’s what I believe. I believe the reason I have COVID-19 is because an invisible demon is molesting me, he is <b>fingering my butthole</b>.</p>
<h1>Near Death Experience<br>(Cognitive Reframing)</h1>
<p>You rarely ever hear about the positive effects of COVID-19. For about 3 years now, I lived inside my messy bedroom. I don’t know how it all got started. A slow progression. I quit mopping, sweeping. I waited until my blankets stinked to finally wash them. Every day, I used my foot as a shovel to clear a path to walk through. Most embarassing of all, there was my cum stained napkins everywhere, and my smeared boogers on my floor. When my electricity broke, I never fixed it, I was too embarrassed to allow a repair man to witness my atrocious bedroom. One day, my mischevious 5 year old nephew hacked his way into my locked bedroom. He caught me completely off guard. I threw a tantrum. I angrily grabbed his shirt and pushed him hard out of my room. It’s possible he tripped and fell hard on the tiled floor. I said “This is the last straw. I need to change myself.” And the following two years later, my room only got messier.</p>
<p>Now recently I suffered through a Near Death Experience caused by COVID-19. Suddenly, I snapped out of it. I cleaned my bedroom. Like it was crazy, all my life I wanted to kill myself, now seconds away from death, the voice in my head said “Ouch! The CIA whacked me! Game over!” And I don’t know. I’m probably still going to kill myself, but atleast my bedroom is clean. I guess the lesson here is. I am glad I am not vaccinated. I am still never taking the vaccine. I recommend everyone should try COVID-19 atleast once in their lifetime. I can honestly say now, COVID-19 healed me, it made me a better person.</p>
