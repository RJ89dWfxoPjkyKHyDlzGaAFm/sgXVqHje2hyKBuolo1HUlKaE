The prevalence of meat consumption became the rhetoric of Nazi Germany to justify a Jewish Holocaust (see argument 7) <a href="https://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/responses.htm">[13]</a>. For example, during 1961 7 billion animals were slaughtered for meat consumption. Humans are a type of animal. If humans already kill billions of animals annually, why would it be any different if they killed a few million humans. 
 
<p>Lobbies are organizations that advise U.S. government. Politicians are not scientists, therefore politicians cannot conduct research, they cannot understand nor have the time to read dense scientific theses. Politicians rely on lobbies such as the North American Meat Institute (NAMI) to advice on what laws to create. The North American Meat Institute's purpose is to study the meat industry, and objectively enumerate the facts to politicians.

<p>(Female) Lorena Bobbitt married to (Male) John Wayne Bobbitt in 1989. On the night of June 23, 1993 after violently raping Lorena Bobbitt, John Wayne Bobbitt quickly became unconscious due to his alcoholism and drug abuse. While John was unconscious, Lorena used a kitchen knife to surgically remove John's penis. Under oath, Lorena testified how she allegedly suffered years of physical and sexual abuse from John the perpetrator. Crucial to John's legal defense was a transcripted interrogation upon Lorena replied "He always has orgasm. He doesn't wait for me to have orgasm. I don't think it's fair, it's selfish." I imagine John's lawyer said to the trial "How is it considered rape when a husband rapes his wife, if the wife technically consented upon marriage? How is it considered illegal to be selfish in bed? I think Lorena has mental illness, but John was the real vicim of spousal abuse."</p>

Both Alton Sterling, and the suspect wore red shirts and sold CDs upon the same parking lot.</p>
