<p>IQ and Global Inequality: The average IQ of Sub Saharan Africans is 67. An IQ of 50 to 70 is considered mild mental retardation.<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pwajBQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&ots=KUDbt0Rk2r&dq=Pediatric%20Clinical%20Advisor&lr&pg=PA369#v=onepage&q&f=false">[9]</a>

<p>Throughout the animal kingdom, male species are biologically wired to fight other males including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0yuOSUSEs">bison</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWtwxurMJNQ">elephants</a>, equine, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_akd-o3ppAE">giraffes</a>, kangaroos, rabbits, rams, roosters. Third Reich rhetoric says if animals instinctively fight, then the same must be true about human instinct, therefore war is justifiable.</p>
 
<p>During a 365 day span in 2018, 72.28 billion mammals were slaughtered because of meat consumption <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/animals-slaughtered-for-meat?time=2018">[12]</a>. Third Reich rhetoric says if humans kill animals, and humans are a type of animal, then a human killing a human is justifiable; therefore Jews are animals the same as parasites <a href="https://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/responses.htm">[13]</a>. Psychopaths are humans who experience no emotions.</p>

<p>Lobbies are organizations that formally advise government decision process. Politicians are not scientists, therefore politicians cannot conduct research, nor have the expertise to comprehend dense scientific theses. Politicians rely on lobbies such as the North American Meat Institute (NAMI) to advice politicians on what laws to create. The North American Meat Institute's purpose is to study the meat industry, and objectively enumerate the facts to the politicians. Meat businesses donate money to NAMI. NAMI uses the donated money to pay scientists and pay politicians. NAMI's twitter informs us that meat doesn't cause cancer <a href="https://twitter.com/MeatInstitute/status/1110214008114679809">[1]</a>, meat doesn't cause antibiotic resistance <a href="https://twitter.com/MeatInstitute/status/594155005369810945">[2]</a>, and meat doesn't cause global warming <a href="https://twitter.com/MeatInstitute/status/1169623972390100993">[3]</a>; which is fine except they are literally advocating killing animals. The National Rifle Association (NRA) is one example of a lobby. The NRA's website informs us that firearms accidental injuries have diminished by 95% since 1903 <a href="https://www.nraila.org/get-the-facts/gun-safety/">[4]</a>, which is fine except if they really cared about people, they would advocate for people to stop killing eachother, but there is no money in doing that. Lobbies are ALWAYS trying to sell THINGS to the public, whether it is meat, guns, tobacco, or oil. There are political lobbies for all major industries including Automotive, Pharmaceuticals/Health, Oil & Gas, Insurance, and Education. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/257364/top-lobbying-industries-in-the-us/">[14]</a></p>
 
<p>Professor Chris Dickman estimates more than 1 billion animals died as an impact of the 2019-2020 australian bushfires. <a href="https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/01/08/australian-bushfires-more-than-one-billion-animals-impacted.html">[15]</a></p>
 
<p>Since 1993-2013 approximately 90 million kangaroos were killed in Australia for commercial purposes. <a href="https://www.animallaw.info/article/overview-laws-governing-kangaroo-culling-australia-0">[16]</a></p>
 
<p>(Female) Lorena Bobbitt married to (Male) John Wayne Bobbitt in 1989. On the night of June 23, 1993 after violently raping Lorena Bobbitt, John Wayne Bobbitt quickly became unconscious due to his alcoholism and drug abuse. While John was unconscious, Lorena used a kitchen knife to surgically remove John's penis. Under oath, Lorena testified how she allegedly suffered years of physical and sexual abuse from John the perpetrator. Crucial to John's legal defense was a transcripted interrogation upon Lorena replied "He always has orgasm. He doesn't wait for me to have orgasm. I don't think it's fair, it's selfish." I imagine John's lawyer said to the trial "How is it considered rape when a husband rapes his wife, if the wife technically consented upon marriage? How is it considered illegal to be selfish in bed? I think Lorena has mental illness, but John was the real vicim of spousal abuse."</p>
