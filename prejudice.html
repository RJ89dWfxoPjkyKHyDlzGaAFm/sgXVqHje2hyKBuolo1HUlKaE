<p>This book is about a woman named Elizabeth Bennet and a man named Fitzwilliam Darcy. Fitzwilliam Darcy is super wealthy, he just moved into town introducing himself with an extravagent banquet. Everyone in town was like "Omg Darcy is so prideful like he literally just started this banquet to celebrate himself by bragging about his money." Then at the banquet Darcy didn't say hello to anyone. Everyone in town was like "Omg Darcy is so prideful he only talks to other rich people. He doesn't talk to the common folk." </p>

<p>Then there is a man named George Wickham. Everyone in town loves George Wichham. George Wichham is tall and handsome. George Wichham is always talking about how he is a solider, and bragging about how humble he is. One day Darcy proposed to Elizabeth but Elizabeth declined because she believed all the bad rumors about him. Then in the end Darcy wrote letters to Elizabeth explaining everything. Darcy was like "Omg I didn't ignore you at the banquet. It's just that your beauty captivated me. I was afraid. I was too self conscious. I'm not good at interacting with common folks, because all I want to do is discuss philosophy, art and sciences. But whenever I discuss these topics people don't relate. It's difficult to make friends because I am too privileged. I just feel lonely all the time."</p>
   
<p>So in end it turns out that George Wickham is a very bad man, he is addicted to gambling, and he married a bunch of women so he could steal their money. Meanwhile Darcy  has better morals. People love George Whicham because George Whicham is always lying to everyone. George Whicham cares about his reputation. But Darcy Bingley only cares about doing good for the public. That's why Darcy made a banquet so people can have fun. I guess the moral of the story is that you shouldn't be prejudiced against people if your opinion is based on rumors and assumptions. I'm certain I have all the details incorrect here but whatever...</p>
   
<p>There was also a man named Mr William Collins. Mr William Collins was desparate for marriage, he proposed to every woman in town until they all rejected him. Mr William Collins never went on dates, he didn't care about personality. Eventually Mr William Collins found someone to marry, and he made sure their marriage was swift. The book never mentioned it but it was clear that Mr William Collins just wanted to marry because he was desparate for sex, but he didn't want to disobey God. I guess it was supposed to be funny or something.</p> 
   
 <p>So anyways people always say that the author Jane Austen is a woman who never had sex, she died a virgin. I don't know if its true. But it's always mentioned by people. And also supposedly the original title of the book was First Impressions but it was renamed Pride and Prejudice because of the success of her previous book titled Sense and Sensibility. So yeah the book is about how First Impressions can be misleading.</p>
