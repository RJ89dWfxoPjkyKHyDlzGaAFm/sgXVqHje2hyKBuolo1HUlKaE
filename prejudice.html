<p>This book is about a woman named Elizabeth Bennet and a man named Darcy Bingley. Darcy Bingley is super wealthy, he just moved into town introducing himself with an extravagent banquet. Everyone in town was like "Omg Darcy is so prideful like he literally just started this banquet to celebrate himself by bragging about his money." Then at the banquet he didn't say hello to anyone. Everyone in town was like "Omg Darcy is so prideful he only talks to other rich people. He doesn't talk to the common folk." </p>

<p>Then there is a man named George Wickham. Everyone in town loves George Wichham. George Wichham is tall and handsome. George Wichham is always talking about how he is a solider, and bragging about how humble he is. One day Darcy proposed to Elizabeth but Elizabeth declined because she believed all the bad rumors about him. Then in end Darcy wrote letters to Elizabeth explaining everything. Darcy was like "Omg I didn't ignore you at the banquet. It's just that your beauty captivated me. I was afraid. I was too self conscious. I'm not good at interacting with common folks, because all I want to do is talk about philosophy, art and sciences. But whenever I discuss these topics people don't relate. It's difficult to make friends because I am too privileged. I just feel lonely all the time."</p>
   
   <p>So in end it turns out that George Wickham is a very bad man. Darcy Bingley has good morals. People love George Whicham because George Whicham is always lying to everyone. George Whicham cares about his reputation. But Darcy Bingley only cares about doing good for the public. That's why Darcy made a banquet so people can have fun. I guess the moral of the story is that you shouldn't be prejudiced against people if your opinion is based on rumors.</p>
