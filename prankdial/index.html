<p>During 2012, I used prankdial.com on Johann Arteaga Ramos. <a href="https://www.prankdial.com/us/pranks/why-you-call-my-girlfriend">This</a> was the exact template I used. We were 14 years old. His website is theWorkofJAR.com. JAR are the intitials of Johann Arteaga Ramos. During 2012, Johann preferred to be called 'Johnny.'</p> 
 
<p>Johann and I went to the same ghetto middle school. I didn't talk to him that much during middle school. I only talked to him a few times. The only thing I knew about was that even during middle school, Johann had a cheap generic-branded flip camera, AND for someone reason EVERYONE hated Johann. Johann's only friends were bandclass students. The first time I met Johann during middle school, Johann said "Everyday afterschool, I always hangout with Luis Pineda at the [restaurant]. I wait for my parents to pick me up there. Jovanny, you should hangout with us too."</p><hr>
 
 
 <h1>TheWeeNose</h1>
 <p><a href="https://youtu.be/pe8pkx_3vsU">TheWeeNose</a> was a Youtube Channel that Johann and I created during August 2011. I created the Youtube Channel. I regrettably selected 'TheWeeNose' as the name of our Youtube Channel. I hate it now, because it sounds like TheWeiner. I was innocent back then. I selected 'Wee' because it is the expression of happiness, when someone is riding a rollercoaster, they might say "Weeeeee." And 'Nose' was supposed to be like when someone says "I got your nose." Together that made 'TheWeeNose.'</p>
 
 <p>During August 2011, I told Johann about TheWeeNose Youtube Channel, Johann replied "Hey! Can I have the password so I can upload a video!" I gave him the password. Johann uploaded a video. A few days passed. I logged onto my facebook. Something was different. I had 20+ facebook notifications. I updated my facebook status to "Sorry if I sent anyone a rude message! Someone hacked my facebook! It wasn't me!"</p>
 
 <p>Someone hacked my facebook account. The computer hacker sent dozens of rude messages to random facebook users. I read one message that said "Jocelyne Acevedo, you are fat and ugly. Gross. You are a disgusting whore!" So I replied to Joceylene Acevedo "Hey! I'm so sorry! That wasn't me! Someone hacked my Facebook account!" Jocelyne replied "Oh! And maybe it was your friend Johnny Ramos who hacked you! Because he has a huge crush on me!"</p>
 
 <p>Finally, I asked Johnny "Was it you? Did you hack my Facebook account?" Johnny replied "Yes, it was me. I am sorry. It's true. I am obsessed with Jocelyne. I promise, I'll never do it again." I asked Johnny "How did you do it? How did you hack my Facebook account?" Johnny said "When you logged onto Facebook from my computer, my laptop inadvertently saved your email address. But I utilized the password you gave me from TheWeeNose Youtube Channel."</p>

<p>During 2012, Johann and I used to walk home together afterschool with a girl named Maribel (I think that was her name). We did this everyday for like 3-4 months. Then, one day at school, Maribel pulled my arm and said "Hi! Jovanny, I need to tell you something. I have a crush on someone." I replied "Okay." Maribel replied "The person who I have a crush on, Jovanny, you know this person very well." Then I was thinking to myself "I know myself very well indeed." Maribel said "I am going to give you a hint! His First name starts with the letter J. His last name starts with the letter R." At this point I was like "OMG she has a crush on me!" Maribel said "His first name starts with the letter J, but his first name ends with the letter Y." I was thinking to myself "OMG she definitely has a crush on me!" Maribel said "Do you know who my crush is?" I replied "No." Maribel said "Okay. Well just think about it. You are friends with this person." I said to myself "I am my own bestfriend." Then Maribel said "Oh your shoe laces are untied!" And then Maribel went on her knees in front of me and started tying my shoe laces. Maribel said "Goodbye Jovanny!" I was thinking to myself "She was flirting with me. That's why she was tying my shoes." Then I went home afterschool and forgot all about what happened. </p>
 
 <p>A few weeks passed. I was at Johann's house. It was me, Johann, and a guy named Dawit. Dawit said "Johann, I can't believe she has a crush on you! Is she now your girlfriend?" Johann said "No. I just see her as a friend." Dawit said "A friend with benefits?" I replied "Hey, what are you guys talking about?" Johann replied "Oh, it's this girl. She has a HUGE crush on me. She keeps texting me everyday." Dawit said "Should we tell him her name?" Johann said "It's Maribel." In that exact moment I had a flashback to what Maribel said. I put it all together. I told Johann "Wait. Maribel told me she had a crush on someone. With the initial JR." Johann said "Oh. Your name on Facebook is Giovanni Pool." It's true! Johann Ramos and I have the same initials. My real name is Jovanny Rodriguez. Johann's name on Facebook was 'Johnny Ramos.' But everyone calls Johann as 'Johnny.'</p>
 
<p>My name on Facebook was Giovanni Pool, because people don't know how to spell Jovanny, they always think it is spelled Giovanni. Pool is my mom's last name, which a long time ago my uncle's grown up friend told me that 'Pool' was a great 'stage name.' So I put Giovanni Pool because I was embarrased that my mom mispelled my first name and people are always saying "How do you spell your name? Should I call you Joe or Gio?" I was embarrassed that I had the most stereotypical Mexican lastname with a mispelled firstname. Like my mom didn't know how to spell or write in English. So I put Giovanni Pool to make my name sound as White and English as possible. Years later, I found out my mom's last name is actually Po'ol with an apostrophe. It is pronounced like two separate words PO Ol. It's a Mayan language lastname, but when my grandparents came to the United States, they simply wrote Pool without an apostrophe on all their legal documents.</p>
 
 <p>I was embarrased that my lastname was Rodriguez, because I was embarrased that my Dad was an ugly bald mexican guy who literally wears sombreros and mexican leather boots. My dad would always carry a tiny bottle of habanero sauce everywhere he went. My dad put habanero on everything. He even put jalapenos on popcorn when we are the theatres. And everytime my Dad was listening to spanish music on the radio, he would do a thing called a Mexican 'grito.'</p>
