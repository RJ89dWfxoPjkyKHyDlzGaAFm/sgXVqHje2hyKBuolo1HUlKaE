<p>During 2012, I used prankdial.com on Johann Arteaga Ramos. <a href="https://www.prankdial.com/us/pranks/why-you-call-my-girlfriend">This</a> was the exact template I used. We were 14 years old. His website is theWorkofJAR.com. JAR are the intitials of Johann Arteaga Ramos. During 2012, Johann preferred to be called 'Johnny.'</p> 
 
<p>Johann and I went to the same ghetto middle school. I didn't talk to him that much during middle school. I only talked to him a few times. The only thing I knew about was that even during middle school, Johann had a cheap generic-branded flip camera, AND for someone reason EVERYONE hated Johann. Johann's only friends were bandclass students. The first time I met Johann during middle school, Johann said "Everyday afterschool, I always hangout with Luis Pineda at the [restaurant]. I wait for my parents to pick me up there. Jovanny, you should hangout with us too."</p>
