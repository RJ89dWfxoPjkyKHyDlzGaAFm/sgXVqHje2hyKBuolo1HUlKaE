<p>During 2012, I used prankdial.com on Johann Arteaga Ramos. <a href="https://www.prankdial.com/us/pranks/why-you-call-my-girlfriend">This</a> was the exact template I used. We were 14 years old. His website is theWorkofJAR.com. JAR are the intitials of Johann Arteaga Ramos. During 2012, Johann preferred to be called 'Johnny.'</p> 
 
<p>Johann and I went to the same ghetto middle school. I didn't talk to him that much during middle school. I only talked to him a few times. The only thing I knew about was that even during middle school, Johann had a cheap generic-branded flip camera, AND for someone reason EVERYONE hated Johann. Johann's only friends were bandclass students. The first time I met Johann during middle school, Johann said "Everyday afterschool, I always hangout with Luis Pineda at the [restaurant]. I wait for my parents to pick me up there. Jovanny, you should hangout with us too."</p><hr>
 
 
 <h1>TheWeeNose</h1>
 <p><a href="https://youtu.be/pe8pkx_3vsU">TheWeeNose</a> was a Youtube Channel that Johann and I created during August 2011. I created the Youtube Channel. I regrettably selected 'TheWeeNose' as the name of our Youtube Channel. I hate it now, because it sounds like TheWeiner. I was innocent back then. I selected 'Wee' because it is the expression of happiness, when someone is riding a rollercoaster, they might say "Weeeeee." And 'Nose' was supposed to be like when someone says "I got your nose." Together that made 'TheWeeNose.'</p>
 
 <p>During August 2011, I told Johann about TheWeeNose Youtube Channel, Johann replied "Hey! Can I have the password so I can upload a video!" I gave him the password. Johann uploaded a video. A few days passed. I logged onto my facebook. Something was different. I had 20+ facebook notifications. I updated my facebook status to "Sorry if I sent anyone a rude message! Someone hacked my facebook! It wasn't me!"</p>
 
 <p>Someone hacked my facebook account. The computer hacker sent dozens of rude messages to random facebook users. I read one message that said "Jocelyne Acevedo, you are fat and ugly. Gross. You're a whore!" So I replied to Joceylene Acevedo "Hey! I'm so sorry! That wasn't me! Someone hacked my Facebook account!" Jocelyne replied "Oh! And maybe it was your friend Johnny Ramos who hacked you! Because he has a huge crush on me!"</p>
 
 <p>Finally, I asked Johnny "Was it you? Did you hack my Facebook account?" Johnny replied "Yes, it was me. I am sorry. It's true. I am obsessed with Jocelyne. I promise, I'll never do it again." I asked Johnny "How did you do it? How did you hack my Facebook account?" Johnny said "I utilized the password you gave me from TheWeeNose Youtube Channel."</p>
