<h1>Brincos Deiras</h1>
<p>Sebastian Ghiorghiu said "I don't want my wife to dress provacatively." Ethan Klein replied "You are an insecure BETA male." Aba & Preach said "Ethan, you are stupid, how would you feel if Hila Klein was twerking on another dude?" And that reminded me of THIS video BELOW!!</p>

<p>Husband caught his wife twerking on another man. The Husband got booed off the stage. According to liberals, if you don't allow your wife to fuck other men, that means you are an insecure BETA male. According to republicans, that woman deserves to be killed.</p>
<p>I found the FULL video!! The video is in spanish titled "Toxic Masulinity Tried To Ruin The Brincos Dieras Show".</p>

<p>Summary/My-Best-Interpretation: The clown said "Can I get a woman from the audience?" The wife volunteered herself, her husband awkwardly smiled. Now, the clown has two women on stage and the clown said "Howdy ladies, how many times per week do you like to FUCK?" The wife replied "7 days per week." The other woman replied "3 times per week." The clown said "You fucking PRUDE!!" The audience laughs. The clown said "Are any of you married?" The wife replied "I am divorced, two times. Right now, I have a boyfriend." The clown said "Twerk on my dick, oh yeah, I'm about to jizz." Both women are twerking on the clown. The husband jumps on stage, yells at his wife, security guards carry the husband away. The clown said "I am sorry that you are in an abusive relationship with an insecure BETA male, please woman, return to your husband before he beats you up." The husband punches a table, the audience throws water bottles at the husband, security guards escort the husband out. The clown tells the other woman "And YOU woman. What does YOUR boyfriend think of you twerking on me?" A new man jumps on the stage and announces on the microphone "I'm not an insecure BETA male, that's why I loan my wife to clown man!" The clown said "WHO gives your wife THE BEST dick?" The man replied "You give her the best dick!" The clown replied "Don't be so hard on yourself, fella, I am certain YOU give her better dick than me." The man replied "No. I never fuck my wife. Only YOU, clown man!" The audience cheers. The clown said "I need a new woman from the audience." A new woman jumps on stage, she grabs the microphone and screams "That other man was an insecure BETA male!!" The audience cheers. The clown said "Bring your husband, tell him to pretend to beat me up out of insecurity. Let us mock the insecure BETA male."</p>
<p>I am fucking dead ass serious dude. Use youtube auto-translate to English. I don't know if they are husband/wife, or just dating, or how long they were dating.</p>
<p>According to this video below, the wife stayed at the show, and the husband was escorted out. Feminists are saying most likely the husband was abusive, and this was the wive's desperate attempt to flee that abusive relationship, the wife is smiling, because she got her sweet revenge. She is now a courageous, brave, freed, liberated woman.</p>
