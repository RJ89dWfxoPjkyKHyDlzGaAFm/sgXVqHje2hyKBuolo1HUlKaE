<p>This song is about:</p>
<p>Elliott Smith is waiting for a train so he could jump in front of it to die by suicide. Now the train tracks are covered in blood that a janitor has to clean, so all of the train's passengers arrived late to work because of a train-suicide. The train is a metaphor because it takes people to very far away places. </p>
