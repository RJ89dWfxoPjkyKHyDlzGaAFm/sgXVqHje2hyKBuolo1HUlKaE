<h1>Statistics and Facts</h1>
 
 <p>There are 686,665 law enforcement officers in the United States of America <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-74">[1]</a>. The FBI defines a law enforcement officer as "Law enforcement officers carry a firearm and a badge, have full arrest powers, and are paid from governmental funds set aside specifically to pay sworn law enforcement."</p>

<p>United States: Prison incarceration rates are 32.2% for black male, 17.2% for hispanic male, 5.9% for white male, 5.6% for black female, 2.2% for hispanic female, 0.9% for white female. <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=836">[1]</a> This means for example, 32.2% of black men will go to prison at atleast one time before dying of old age. The statistic excludes jails and probation/parole. According to Prison Policy, there are more people on probation/parole, than there are people in prison/jail <a href="https://static.prisonpolicy.org/images/pie2019_correctional_control.png">[2]</a>. In other words, every single black man in America is either harassed or indirectly affected by law enforcement. </p>
 
<p>United States: Comparing equal crime and criminal history: Black males received 19.1% LONGER prison sentences than white males. Black females received 29.7% SHORTER prison sentences than white males. The United States Sentencing Commission says "Female offenders of all races received shorter sentences than white male offenders." <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/demographic-differences-sentencing">[1]</a> It is believed, when considering the fact women are less likely to be arrested/convicted of felony; therefore ALL men receive 63% longer prison sentences than ALL women no matter the racial bias <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2144002">[2]</a>. For example, women go to jail instead of prison. According to Bureau of Justice, jail is defined as one year or less <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=qa&iid=322">[3]</a> incarceration. Prison is defined as more than one year incarceration.</p>

<p>(Female) Lorena Bobbitt married to (Male) John Wayne Bobbitt in 1989. On the night of June 23, 1993 after violently raping Lorena Bobbitt, John Wayne Bobbitt quickly became unconscious due to his alcoholism and drug abuse. While John was unconscious, Lorena used a kitchen knife to surgically remove John's penis. Under oath, Lorena testified how she allegedly suffered years of physical and sexual abuse from John the perpetrator. Crucial to John's legal defense was a transcripted interrogation upon Lorena replied "He always has orgasm. He doesn't wait for me to have orgasm. I don't think it's fair, it's selfish." I imagine John's lawyer said to the trial "How is it considered rape when a husband rapes his wife, if the wife technically consented upon marriage? How is it considered illegal to be selfish in bed? I think Lorena has mental illness, but John was the real vicim of spousal abuse."</p>
