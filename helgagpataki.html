<h1>Helga G Pataki</h1>
<p>a)<br>H is for the Head I like to punt.<br>E is for Everytime I see the little runt.<br>L is for Longing for our first kiss.<br>G is for how Good that longing is.<br>A is for Arnold.</p>
<p>b) Arnold, what a boob. What an annoying smartypants know it all. How I despise him. And yet. I love him. His noble curiosity, his cool keen powers of observation, his unfaltering sense of right and wrong. Oh, if only I could find the strength to tell him how much I adore him. If only there was some way I could let him know, some way I could whisper my secret adoring thoughts, sooth this fevered unibrowed. Dare I think it? Kiss the lips that haunt my girlish dreams. Oh if only, if only.</p>
<p>c) Why must I hold you only whilst I dream? Will I forever be enslaved by your spell? Why must I worship you and never tell? Arnold, you make my girlhood tremble, my senses all go wacky. Someday I'll tell the world my love or my name is not Helga G Pataki.</p>
<p>d) Cowlicks, like fields of yellow corn. All the days of my week, I write the name I dare not speak. The boy with the cornflour hair, my beloved, and my despair.</p>
<p>e) Oh, Arnold! So discriminating, so patient and thoughtful. Spurning the golden girl and saving his affections for one less likely, yet perhaps ultimately more deserving. One who may not be the prettiest or the wittiest, but whose primitive beauty, grace and charms lie tragically unobserved and unawakened. Someone... like... me... Helga G. Pataki.</p>
<p>f) Oh Arnold! Bane of my existence, blight upon my tortured heart if only you knew my true feelings for you. And if only you felt the same true feelings untowards me. Dare I imagine, if only for one brief mad moment it were true? Call me mad, but I dare. I dare with this chalk and no witnesses in sight that I will write the words upon this wall which bear my soul expressing all I hope, I dream, I pine and I pray was true forever and a day. Arnold… Loves… Helga.</p>
