<h1>Helga G Pataki</h1>
<p>a) H is for the Head I like to punt. E is for Everytime I see the little runt. L is for Longing for our first kiss. G is for how Good that longing is. A is for Arnold.</p>
<p>b) Cowlicks, like fields of yellow corn. All the days of my week, I write the name I dare not speak. The boy with the cornflour hair, My beloved, and my despair.</p>
<p>c) Oh, Arnold! So discriminating, patient and thoughtful. Spurning the golden girl and saving his affections for one less likely, yet perhaps ultimately more deserving. One who may not be the prettiest or the wittiest, but whose primitive beauty, grace and charms lie tragically unobserved and unawakened. Someone... like... me... Helga G. Pataki.</p>
<p>d) Oh Arnold! Bane of my existence, blight upon my tortured heart if only you knew my true feelings for you. And if only you felt the same true feelings untowards me. Dare I imagine, if only for one brief mad moment it were true? Call me mad, but I dare. I dare with this chalk and no witnesses in sight. I will write the words upon this wall which bear my soul expressing all I hope, I dream, I pine and I pray was true forever and a day. Arnold… Loves… Helga.</p>
