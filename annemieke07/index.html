<p>This was my first impression of annemieke07. I think this was written during August 2019.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kristen_meetme7/">Kristen_MeetMe7</a></p>
<p>She was a streamer on the MeetMe app, where I discovered her. I witnessed two live streams, both times she was drinking alcoholic beverages. The second live stream, she appeared very drunk and sad. She ended her stream earlier than usual that day, when she professed that she was very tired. One user commented, "Would you like me to give you a massage <img style="display:inline; height:1em;" src="devil.png">?" Kristen responded "No. You are delusional for believing I might accept a massage from a stranger on the internet. If I wanted a massage, then I would pay for it from a qualified establishment. Additionally, I would never pay for a sexual massage <img style="display:inline; height:1em;" src="expletive.png">." I felt sad for Kristen. The first time I witnessed her, she typically swooned me with charisma. Now, I had a reason to believe that she was struggling with alcoholism. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BvAvHu4nUjb/">Here</a> is a video of Kristen drinking to her fans.</p>
