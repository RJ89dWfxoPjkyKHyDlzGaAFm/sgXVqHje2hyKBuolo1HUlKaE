 <p class="paragraph1">She is a streamer on the MeetMe app, where I discovered her. I witnessed two live streams, both times she was drinking alcoholic beverages.
 The second live stream, she appeared very drunk and sad. She ended her stream earlier than usual that day, when she professed she was very tired.
 One man commented, "Would you like me to give you a massage?" Kristen responded "No. You are delusional for believing I might accept a massage
 from a stranger on the internet. If I wanted a massage, I would pay for it from a qualified establishment. Additionally, I would never pay
 for a massage that was sexual." I felt sad for Kristen. The first time I witnessed her, she typically swooned me with charisma. Now, I
 had a reason to believe that she was struggling with alcoholism. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BvAvHu4nUjb/">Here</a> is a video of
 Kristen drinking to her fans.</p>
