<p style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">"Among the Sambia of the Eastern Highlands of Papaua New Guinea, young boys perform oral sex on, and ingest the semen of, older men, as part of a rite of passage to adulthood. Oral sex is definitely happening. But it's not clear if this should be thought of as sexual in the way we understand it." - Quote by Nicole Sweeney from CrachCourse Youtube Channel</p>

<p>The Sambia tribe who live in Papua New Guinea practice a tradition of grooming 6 year old boys. When the boys turn 15 years old, the boys are forced to give oral sex to the Sambia male tribe leaders. The boys are forced to drink semen. Semen drinking is a "right of passage" into adulthood. According to liberals, forcing boys to drink semen is a peaceful tradition that white people should learn to love, appreciate, and preserve. According to liberals, drinking semen is not sexual at all to those Sambia boys. It only appears sexual to white people because white people are judgmental. In nature there is no such thing as a right or a wrong way to have sex. 90% of giraffes practice homosexuality. If you put any two animals in a cage, those animals will have sex regardless of sex and age. Animals will have sex even with their own cousins, brothers, sisters, mothers, and fathers. Humans are the only species on Earth who arbitrarily decided certain types of sex is wrong. According to liberals, semen drinking is the Sambia version of a sweet sixteen, or a quinceanera. White people have no right to stop the Sambia semen tradition. Just let them be. If you try to stop the Sambia semen tradition, you are a racist fascist imperialist.</p>


<p>This below chart says biological sex is a social construct <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/visualizing-sex-as-a-spectrum/">1</a>. According to liberals, the theory of sex being determined by chromosomes was invented by white supremacists who believed sex is binary because the Bible said God created only two sexes called Adam and Eve. Obviously, the Bible is wrong. In 2017, modern science proved there is an unlimited number of genders and sexes.<img src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/File/051_sad0917MontA3p-01.png"></p>

<p>According to liberals, biological sex is a social construct exactly like race is a social construct. There is no such thing as "man" or "woman" just like there is no "European" or "African." Sexuality is a learned behavior. The only reason you are heterosexual is because all your life you were brainwashed into believing homosexuality was immoral. And deep down you repressed your homosexuality because of the lies systemic oppression created.</p>
