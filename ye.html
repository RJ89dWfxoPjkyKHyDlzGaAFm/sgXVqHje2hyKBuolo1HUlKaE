<p>Do you know why Kanye West changed his name to Ye? Because West is the name given to him by his jewish slave owners. So he changed his name to YE to write his own destiny.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, there are 243 documentary films about the Holocaust <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Holocaust_films#Documentary_films">1</a>, but only 14 documentary films about slavery <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Documentary_films_about_slavery_in_the_United_States">2</a>. There are more documentaries about Big Foot & UFOs than actual slavery.</p>

<p>Every time I see a jewish "holocaust survivor" on Tik-Tok, they always live in a beautiful mansion. Meanwhile, every homeless person on skid-row is black. Show me a video of a jew being killed by the police. It doesn't exist. I can show you hundreds of videos of police murdering blacks on the streets.</p>

<p>You can't fight hate with more hate. Love is the only way. Go ahead and give your local nazi a hug, because without love, that's how you become a nazi yourself. No one deserves to die. No one. Not even Adolf Hitler deserved to die. Adolf Hitler wasn't a "demon". He was a human being in desparate need of love.</p>

<p>42% of Americans would use a time machine to kill <b>baby</b> Adolf Hitler. How did we reach this point where we are killing innocent babies! I would not kill Adolf Hitler, instead, I would give him a loving family.</p>
