<h1>@PB_Nerd, the top moderator of r/h3h3productions brags about having sex with 12 year olds, and is obsessed about Lia Marie Johnson.</h1>
<p><a href="PB_Nerd.html">https://JovannyR.com/h3tml/PB_Nerd</a></p>
<p>@PB_Nerd gave out moderator badges and free Teddy Fresh merch to underage girls in exchange for nudes. Everyone knows about it, including Ethan Klein. And yet @PB_Nerd was never banned for it, he is still out here moderating hate speech.</p>

<p>Here is the youtuber who broke the news. Couple days later, @PB_Nerd deleted his reddit.</p>

<p>Here is @PB_Nerd's collection of Lia Marie Johnson photos. Click on a photo, and it says "PB_Nerd 8 years ago."</p>

<h1>Latest Updates</h1>
<p>Please do not harass any of the names I am about to mention below!</p>

<h1>New Lead</h1>
<p>According to this google docs <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=17RfC0xMw8dsl5lV10RTtUqgG4OjHlrmX">1</a>, PB_Nerd's real name is allegedly Josh Parker, and below was PB_Nerd's snapchat profile pic.</p>

<p>Today, I found a Josh Parker commenting on Ethan Klein's facebook [<a href="https://www.facebook.com/H3h3productions/photos/there-seems-to-be-some-misunderstandings-about-hila-klein-and-her-role-in-h3h3-l/689056517841781/">1</a>]! This Josh Parker is from Arlington, Virginia. PB_Nerd claimed to be from "Northern-Virginia/DC area <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/6qreps/comment/dkzelt1/">1</a>". This Josh Parker talks about "Monstercat, EDM, PC gaming" and I saw PB_Nerd talked about those same exact topics [<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/4ws7de/comment/d69p1rx/">1</a>,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/45eoaw/comment/d066ewv/">2</a>,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/602iv4/comment/df3j5pu/">3</a>]!</p>

<p>This Josh Parker turned 17 years old around March 28, 2016 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1238329156196836">1</a>. If we assume Josh Parker and PB_Nerd are the same person, therefore, PB_Nerd was 18-19 while sexting a 14-15 BeanieBitch <a href="images/pbnerd.avif">1</a>.</p>

<p>Some users reported hearing a voice recording of PB_Nerd during 2018 bragging about "fucking a 14 year old", "buttering her up", and specifically he also said "there are 12 year olds hotter than the girls in my grade".</p>

<p>However, there is a bigger story here. The screenshots below suggests PB_Nerd was not the biggest predator on r/h3h3productions. PB_Nerd was only famous for being the creator of r/h3h3productions. There were more predators. Something bigger. And I believe that's why Ethan Klein refused to acknownledge it. I don't know for sure. But I think it has something to do with the moderator known as "Master K*ke".</p>

<p>Could it be possible that the Master K*ke is in fact the real Ethan Klein himself?! His photo appears to be Satan spanking Eve. It appears he was involved in hiding evidence.</p>
