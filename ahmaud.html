<h1>Ahmaud Arbery</h1>
<p>During 2017, while I was homeless, a man striked up a conversation with me. He was an interesting personality and one day he said to me "Listen. Let me tell you something. If you rob a house at night, it legally called a 'burglary.' But if you rob a house at daytime, it is legally called 'housebreaking.' If you are robbing a house, you should never bring a weapon with you. Do you know why? If you robbed a house with a weapon, it is considered an attempted rape or murder."
  
  <p>Coincidentally, Ahmaud Arbery was at a property without a weapon during the daylight hours.</p>
