<h1>Ahmaud Arbery</h1>
<p>This is a true story. But I changed his name to Ahmaud Arbery for a specific reason, and also to protect his identity. During 2017, a man named Ahmaud striked up a conversation with me. I saw him again at 2018. I said to him "Ahmaud, is there a way I could contact you?" He replied "I don't have a phone number, but you can search me up on Facebook, my name is Ahmaud Arbery." I found him on facebook and SoundCloud. I even found his criminal record online! But I can't post his info like that. I knew it was HIS criminal record, because of the names of the cities listed. It says "Shoplifting, Warrants OR Holds Only, Resist/Obstruct/Delay Peace Officer, Possession of Controlled Substance, Possession of Drug Paraphernalia."</p>
  
<p>The first time I met Ahmaud, I was sitting down on bricks next to a carwash. Ahmaud sat next to me and said "I didn't mean to disturb you. This is where I normally sit why my friends who will be here soon. We occassionally smoke marijuana here." Ahmaud began smoking a marijuana blunt and said "Would you like to smoke some with me?" I replied "No." Ahmaud said "Do you know the song by Sublime? That is how I am. I smoke one blunt alone. Then I smoke a second blunt with friends."
  
</p>Ahmaud said "I'm going to be honest with you. I am high on methamphetamine right now. Please, do not think of me as a meth addict. I rarely do methamphetamine. I tried nearly every street drug that exists here, but my one true love is Marijuana. I tried morphine, fentanyl, MDMA, cocaine, crack, PCP, LSD, Psyilocybin, DMT etc." Ahmaud said "Wait here." Then he ran to a store and purchased a tall can of beer, and started drinking it. He sat down next to me again.</p>

 <p>Three strangers greeted Ahmaud and me. They shared a marijuana blunt together. One pushed a shopping cart and said "Do you wanna buy a television?" He left. One saw a woman walkby, he waited until she was very far away, and then he said "Cuanto para dallas?" Ahmaud replied "Dallas que? Dallas Nalgas." Ahmaud turned and said to me "Dallas is a famous city in Texas, United States. 'Cuanto para dallas', means 'what is the financial cost of a plane ticket to Dallas, Texas?' But in Spanish, 'dallas' means 'to give something.' Cuanto para dallas nalgas, means 'what is the financial burden for that woman to give me her buttocks?' It's a pun."</p>

  "Listen. Let me tell you something. If you rob a house at night, it is legally called a 'burglary.' But if you rob a house at daytime, it is legally called 'housebreaking.' The difference is that housebreaking could be a misdemeanor, and burglary is always a felony. If you are robbing a house, you should never bring a weapon with you. Do you know why? If you rob a house with a weapon, it is legally considered an attempted rape or murder."
  
<p>Coincidentally, Ahmaud Arbery was at a property without a weapon during the daylight hours.</p>
