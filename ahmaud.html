<h1>Ahmaud Arbery</h1>
  
<p>The first time I met Ahmaud, I was sitting down on bricks next to a carwash. Ahmaud sat next to me and said "I didn't mean to disturb you. This is where I normally sit with my friends who will be here soon. We occassionally smoke marijuana here." Ahmaud began smoking a marijuana blunt and said "Would you like to smoke some with me?" I replied "No." Ahmaud said "Do you know the <a href="https://youtu.be/ZlpAAHar96E?t=19">song</a> by Sublime? That is how I am. I smoke one blunt alone. Then I smoke a second blunt with friends."</p>
  
<p>Ahmaud said "I'm going to be honest with you. I am high on methamphetamine right now. Please, do not think of me as a meth addict. I rarely do methamphetamine. I tried nearly every street drug that exists here, but my one true love is Marijuana. I tried morphine, fentanyl, MDMA, cocaine, crack, PCP, LSD, Psyilocybin, DMT etc." Ahmaud said "Wait here." Then he ran to a store, purchased two tall cans of beer, and started drinking them. He sat down next to me again.</p>

 <p>Three strangers greeted Ahmaud and me. The strangers and Ahmaud shared a marijuana blunt together. One pushed a shopping cart and said "Do you wanna buy a television?" One saw a woman walkby, he waited until the woman was very far away, and then he said "Cuanto para dallas?" Ahmaud replied "Dallas que? Dallas Nalgas." Ahmaud turned and said to me "Dallas is a famous city in Texas, United States. 'Cuanto para dallas', means 'what is the financial cost of a plane ticket to Dallas, Texas?' But in Spanish, 'dallas' means 'to give something.' Cuanto para dallas nalgas, means 'what is the financial burden for that woman to give me her buttocks?' It's a pun."</p>
  
  
 <p>Ahmaud said "Tell him about the girl." Ahmaud's African-American friend said "I am 42 years old. One decade ago, I was addicted to crack. I began selling crack to pay for my own addiction. One day, I sold $5,000 worth of crack. I had $5,000 in an envelop in my pocket. I went home. I had a gorgeous woman on my bed. I had sex with her. The next morning, I woke up. I looked at my clothes. I looked in my pockets. The woman was gone, and my $5,000 was gone too! She stole $5,000 from me!" Ahmaud said to me "Haha, but she is still our friend, because dude she fucks like crazy. She will BLOW your mind. And she smokes marijuana. She is a 10/10. Do you wanna meet her?" I replied "No."</p>

 <p>I asked Ahmaud "What does crack feel like?" Ahmaud said "You straight up hallucinate. It feels like you're watching a movie. Some will try to warn you that crack feels better than sex. Truth is. Nothing feels better than sex. Nothing."</p>
  
<p>Ahmaud said "Ask anyone on the streets, they will tell you that crack is the best drug in the world. Every homeless person knows that crack is the best drug in the world. Homeless people don't do crack, because it costs too much. Crack costs the same as meth, but a crack high only lasts 5 minutes. A meth high could last you the whole day. You could waste your whole life away just doing meth."</p> 

<p>The shopping cart guy replied "I used to search for coins at drive thru windwows. They are always dropping coins at drive thru windows. I used to search for scratch off lottery tickets too. I used to see alcoholics throw stacks of lottery tickets in the trash. I re-checked the lottery tickets, using a barcode scanner. Every lotto has a barcode. If the barcode wasn't scratched off, that means the drunk idiot didn't verify them. I would make $2 or $10. I did all this just to desperately buy crack. Now I just collect cans. It's like Ahmaud said, I would rather do meth because it lasts longer. You'll want to smoke crack every 5 minutes like it's a cigarette."</p>
  
<p>Ahmaud said "Crack is called 'freebase cocaine.' You boil cocaine, with any chemical that contains hydroxide ions, such as baking soda or ammonia. The hydroxide ions neutralizes the hydrochloride in the cocaine. The result is you now have the purest-bioavailable form of cocaine. During the 1960s, tobacco companies understood that freebasing made drugs bioavailable, so they started cooking tobbacco with ammonia and that made it more addicting. It was called 'freebase nicotine.' <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2424107/">[1]</a>"</p>
  
<p>There was no beer left. Ahmaud stepped on his second tall can of beer, and tossed it in the shopping cart. Amaud said "Let me ask you something. What time is best the time to burglarize a house?" I replied "During the night." Ahmaud said "Ask any common street criminal, they will tell you 'the best time to burgarlize a house is during daylight.' Do you know why?" I replied "No." Ahmaid said "According to English Common Law <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Map_of_the_Legal_systems_of_the_world_%28en%29.png">[2]</a>: A house robbery during daylight is legally called a 'housebreaking,' which would give you 12 months in jail. But a house robbery at night is legally called a 'burglary,' which would give you 25 years in prison. A house robbery during daylight is viewed as a crime of 'opportunity' which means civilian was jogging but noticed an opened garage door. Also, you should NEVER carry a gun with you during a house robbery. A house robbery with a weapon would land you a lifetime in prison."</p>
