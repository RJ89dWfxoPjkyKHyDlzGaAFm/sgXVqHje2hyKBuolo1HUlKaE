<h1>Ahmaud Arbery</h1>
<p>During 2017, while I was homeless, a man striked up a conversation with me. I am not joking, his name was Brahayan Marquez. I found him on SoundCloud. I recognize his photos. He used to have a different photo. He changed it. He was an interesting personality and one day he said to me "Listen. Let me tell you something. If you rob a house at night, it is legally called a 'burglary.' But if you rob a house at daytime, it is legally called 'housebreaking.' The difference is that housebreaking could be a misdemeanor, and burglary is always a felony. If you are robbing a house, you should never bring a weapon with you. Do you know why? If you rob a house with a weapon, it is legally considered an attempted rape or murder."
  
<p>Coincidentally, Ahmaud Arbery was at a property without a weapon during the daylight hours.</p>
