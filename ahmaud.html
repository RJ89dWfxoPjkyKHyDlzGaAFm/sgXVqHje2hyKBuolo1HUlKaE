<h1>Ahmaud Arbery</h1>
<p>This is a true story. But I changed his name to Ahmaud Arbery for a specific reason, and also to protect his identity. During 2017, a man named Ahmaud striked up a conversation with me. I saw him again at 2018. I said to him "Ahmaud, is there a way I could contact you?" He replied "I don't have a phone number, but you can search me up on Facebook, my name is Ahmaud Arbery." I found him on facebook and SoundCoud. I even found his criminal record online! But I can't post his info like that. I know it's Ahmaminal record, because of the listed cities. It says "Shoplifting, Warrants OR Holds Only, Resist/Obstruct/Delay Peace Officer, Possession of Controlled Substance, Possession of Drug Paraphernalia."  
  
The first time I met Brahayan, I was sitting"Listen. Let me tell you something. If you rob a house at night, it is legally called a 'burglary.' But if you rob a house at daytime, it is legally called 'housebreaking.' The difference is that housebreaking could be a misdemeanor, and burglary is always a felony. If you are robbing a house, you should never bring a weapon with you. Do you know why? If you rob a house with a weapon, it is legally considered an attempted rape or murder."
  
<p>Coincidentally, Ahmaud Arbery was at a property without a weapon during the daylight hours.</p>
